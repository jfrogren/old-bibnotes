# Notes on O’Sullivan, R. (2018) - Research partnerships-embracing user involvement: practical considerations and reflections

Artikelförfattaren reflekterar i artikeln över de lärdomar som kan dras kopplat till den samverkansforskning som bedrivits vid ett forskningscenter (åldrandeforskning) på Irland under åtta års tid. Den övergripande slutsatsen är: 

> In summary, the author emphasises that for research partnerships involving users to be successful, they need to not only consider the most effective research methods, but also focus on the overarching purpose of the work and adopt an ethos and practice that maximises each partner’s knowledge and expertise to their full potential. [p. 221]

Lite lagom vagt kanske.

Denna artikel kan vara inspirerande för mig inte minst för min sista studie där jag på ett liknande sätt ska försöka sammanfatta erfarenheterna av CASE arbete med brukarmedverkan. Artiklar som denna blir av förklarliga skäl lite självhyllande, men jag tycker att den innehöll mycket bra referenser kopplade till 'user involvement'. I en starkt brittisk kontext visserligen, men jag uppfattar det som att vårt arbete vid CASE också är starkt influerat av vad britterna har gjort inom detta område. 

#### The terms collaboration, cooperation, coalition, network, strategic alliance and partnership are used interchangeably

> Terms such as collaboration, cooperation, coalition, network, strategic alliance and partnership are often used interchangeably (Boydell, 2007). [p. 221]

#### 'Empowerment' as defined by WHO
> The World Health Organization (WHO), in their 2010 report on “User empowerment in mental health – a statement by the WHO Regional Office for Europe”, describes empowerment as the process of // taking control, taking responsibility and providing the potential to build capacity. It includes four dimensions: self-reliance, participation in decision making, dignity and respect, and belonging and contributing to a wider community. The authors indicate that “the key to empowerment is the removal of formal or informal barriers and the transformation of power relations […]. Power is central to the idea of empowerment, and one important element of empowerment strategies[…]”. [p. 221-222]

#### Foucault om hur kunskap och makt hör samman

> When writing on this issue, Foucault emphasised that power is not simply a top down issue but rather a moving one, according to context and timing. He states: “Power is everywhere” and “comes from everywhere” and viewed it as neither an agency nor a structure (Foucault, 1998, p. 63). Furthermore, for Foucault power and knowledge are inextricably related, he regarded knowledge as an exercise of power and power as a function of knowledge. Therefore, in this context power can revolve around the partnership as it can around empowerment, knowledge and expertise. [p. 222]

#### O'Sullivan om vad 'effective cross-sectoral research partnerships' går ut på

> In summary, effective cross-sectoral research partnerships are focused on more than understanding the issues from a different perspective, or giving people an opportunity to have a say. Rather, it is recognition that those outside academia and one’s discipline, possess different knowledge and expertise which can benefit research and can help drive the change the partnership may wish to see happen. Principally, it is about appreciating the diversity of skills and knowledge that are academic, practical, policy based or from the lived experience. [p. 222]

#### 'User involvement' enligt Futurage

> User involvement means to concretely engage users at all stages, to design with them their role throughout the process, to take into account their needs and concerns throughout the whole process […]. This implies the need for sufficient resources, which are not only related to research funding, but also to human support. User involvement implies the sharing of research outcomes with the users who take part in the activities, as well as involving them in the evaluation and eventual follow-up (Futurage, 2011, pp. 85-6).

#### INVOLVE om skillnaden mellan 'user involvement', 'participation' och 'public engagement'

> INVOLVE, a National Health Service advisory group, funded by the National Institute for Health Research that supports public involvement in health and social care research, provides a useful distinction:

> + *User involvement*: members of the public are actively involved in research projects. In the health sector, this is increasingly referred to as PPI.

> + *Participation*: describes people taking part in a research study as subjects of the research.

> + *Public engagement*: information about research is provided and disseminated to the public.Activities include science festivals, open days, media and communications. The National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement describes engagement as a two-way process, involving interaction and listening, with the goal of generating mutual benefit (www.invo.org.uk; www.publicengagement.ac.uk). [p. 222]

#### Enligt Murtagh är 'user involvement' kontroversiellt och det har riktats kritik mot det

> As Murtagh (2014a, p. 11) stated: "It is important to recognise that user involvement is itself a controversial subject. Critics point to a lack of compelling evidence that it adds value, while advocates are critical of the tokenistic nature of previous attempts to engage older people in research and advocacy." [p. 222]

#### 'User involvement' används idag i syftet "to design programmes and services that are most effective"

> Nevertheless, researchers, government, funders, businesses and service providers are increasingly recognising the benefits of “user” involvement to design programmes and service that are most effective. [p. 222]

#### Bland de viktigaste tjänster, policies och program som samhället har till uppgift att få till på ett effektivt sätt hör de som riktar sig till vår åldrande befolkning

> Nowhere is this more important than in planning and delivering services, policy and programmes for our ageing population. [p. 222]

#### Issues affecting an ageing population do not respect boundaries and thus the solutions requires utilisation of knowledge and expertise from various stakeholders

> The issues affecting older people, and indeed an ageing population do not respect departmental, sectoral or indeed geographical boundaries.Therefore, providing effective planning relies on the utilisation of knowledge and expertise from a range of stakeholders especially representative organisations, charities jjand older people themselves. [p. 222]


#### Potential of 'user involvement' as described by Barnes and Taylor

> The potential of user involvement for Barnes and Taylor (2009) is that it can help research have a greater impact, produce research that is considered relevant and important by older people and their organisations as well as generate data for advocacy, service delivery and policy and can develop skills amongst older people and NGOs.

#### Academic knowledge sometimes in conflict with knowledge of policy makers, practitioners and service users

> The drive of the user involvement agenda is reflected in Bannister and Hardill (2013, p. 5) who recognise that there are various forms of evidence and knowledge informing the design, delivery or evaluation of public services. Academic knowledge “sits alongside, sometimes in conflict and sometimes in harmony, with the knowledge of policy makers, practitioners and service users.” [p. 222]

#### Driving premise for knowledge co-production according to Vindrola-Padros et al. is that there are multiple and coexisting forms of knowledge

> Writing on the challenges of knowledge co-production, in the context of improving the quality of care, Vindrola-Padros et al. (2018) note the driving premise is that there are multiple and coexisting forms of knowledge: "The underlying assumption is that if knowledge is created through the interaction of these different groups of stakeholders, it will be able to reflect a wider range of perspectives, provide insight into the issues affecting each group, be more relevant to the local context and, therefore, more easily translatable into changes in policy and practice. (p. 1)" [p. 225]

#### A strong collaborative partnership requires a logical mixture of disciplines (and personalities) to be successful

> A strong collaborative partnership requires a vision and an interdisciplinary value base focused on utilising the expertise of those inside and outside one’s discipline and particularly outside the university gates. To be effective [...] it is not simply about getting people involved – rather it is about getting the right team mix. For an application to be successful on paper and in its desired outcome, it is key that there is a logical mixture of disciplines (and personalities) rather than just different disciplines, sectors and older people. It must be a grouping that will advance and actually benefit the outcome of the work and the partners involved. [p. 226]

#### A strong collaborative partnership requires an approach that focuses on promoting mutual dependency to build a feeling of group ownership and responsibility

> At its core there must be an ethos that promotes interdependence while respecting individual roles and expertise. [p. 226]

> What is required for success is an approach that focuses on promoting mutual dependency to build a feeling of group ownership and responsibility along with momentum. [p. 226]


####  A strong collaborative partnership requires an approach that ensures that users can be involved in a way that meets their needs, not just those of the researcher or the service planner

> ...a key element of successful partnerships involves building relationships and working in partnership with service users and older people. This requires an approach that ensures that users can be involved in a way that meets their needs, not just those of the researcher or the service planner. It may seem rather obvious but clearly explaining roles and what is expected of the various partnerships helps to avoid any confusion and disappointment or alternatively maximises valuable involvement, insight and provides opportunities that may otherwise be missed. It is also important to make it clear that the research process takes time to complete in order to ensure that the results are robust and that the research in itself does not necessarily lead to the change partner participants may wish to see. [p. 226]


#### Service users have the capacity to (alongside academics) review grants

> some funders such as The Alzheimer’s Society (Sorensen, 2009) and the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland have involved service users (families and/or people with dementia) alongside academics in reviewing grants and this model successfully shaped what was funded. [p. 227]

#### 'User involvement' måste ske med lyhördhet inför hur mycket och vilken typ av involvering äldre personer själva önskar

> ...as Doyle (2009) reflected, the case for user involvement must connect with the practicalities and realities of involvement, for example, how much or what type of involvement do older people actually want? [p. 227]

#### Lavis et al.'s three types of research/user interaction: producer-push, user pull and exchange

> Lavis et al. (cited by Bannister and Hardill, 2013, p. 5) characterise three types of research/user interaction: producer-push, user-pull and exchange: "The first of these emphasises the active role taken by researchers in communicating the messages from their research; the second highlights the need for potential research users to create an environment whereby research is actively valued, sought and used; and the third (“exchange”) outlines models of interaction between researchers and users that emphasise joint actions in the defining, creation, validation and use of research.

#### Knowledge brokerage 

> Knowledge brokerage forms an important function in connecting various groupings in the context of // supporting user involvement and developing cross-sectoral partnerships. Glegg and Hoens (2016) state: "Knowledge brokers [KB] bridge different disciplines and sectors by developing a common language, by fostering interactions between individuals that generate a shared understanding of their issues and objectives, and by reshaping knowledge to improve its meaningfulness and applicability across contexts. From this perspective, KBs move among groups fostering collaborative processes, with the aim of generating new “brokered” knowledge that is more robust and readily applicable within its intended local context (Meyer cited Glegg and Hoens (2016, p. 15)). [p. 227-228]

#### The five domains for knowledge brokering as set out by Glegg and Hoens (2016)

> ...the five domains for knowledge brokering as set out by Glegg and Hoens (2016):
> 1. Information manager: sourcing, organising, translating and sharing ageing evidence from research, policy and practice.
> 2. Linking agent: building connections and relationships between stakeholders – academic, charities, policy makers and older people across Ireland, North and South.
> 3. Capacity builder: supporting and encouraging skill development, through our funding, workshops, publications and online resources as well as addressing barriers both financial and intellectual (Murtagh, 2014a, b).
> 4. Facilitators: guiding and supporting connections across disciplines, borders and sectors including an extensive database.
> 5. Evaluators: focusing on the end use of the research and the desired outcome and impact. [p. 228]
