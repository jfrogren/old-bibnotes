# Notes on Smith et al. (2008) - Service user involvement in nursing, midwifery and health visiting research: a review of evidence and practice

Detta är en något senare artikel där Fiona Ross ingår som författare jämfört med den artikel hon skrivit själv med titeln 'Involving older people in research: methodological issues'.

Från att ha benämnt fenomenet 'consumer involvement' pratas det i denna artikel om 'service users' och 'service user involvement'. Oklart varför denna beteckning vunnit mark men det är nog så att t.ex. Beresford (som ju är sisteförfattare på denna artikel) har haft ett inflytande skulle jag tro.

#### Bakgrund och syfte

> UK policy recommends that service users (patients, carers and the public) should be involved in all publicly funded health and social care research. However, little is known about which approaches work best in different research contexts and why. The purpose of this paper is to explain some of the theoretical limitations to current understandings of service user involvement and to provide some suggestions for theory and methods development. This paper draws upon ﬁndings from a review of the research ‘evidence’ and current practice on service user involvement in the design and undertaking of nursing, midwifery and health visiting research.

> The aim of the study was to inform the NHS Service Delivery and Organisation (SDO) Research and Development Programme about the theory and evidence on service user involvement in the design and undertaking of nursing, midwifery and health visiting research. [300]


#### Definition of 'service user'

> We chose to use the Department of Health deﬁnition of a ‘service user’: any person who has, is, or may access NHS or independent sector health services in the UK (Department of Health (DH), 1999). [300]

Här blir det tydligt hur vår breda definition av 'brukare' eller 'kunskapsanvändare' ter sig olämplig tycker jag. 'Service user' har en tydlig koppling till hälso- och sjukvårdskonsumption. Punkt slut.

#### Svårt att utvärdera effekten av 'service user involvement'

> User involvement may be seen as a way of ensuring that research is more relevant to the groups that it intends to inform, or more appropriate to the communities it intends to serve. However, at a project level it is difﬁcult to show whether either of these aims have been achieved because it is not possible to know what the outcomes of the research might have been without the involvement of service users. [305]

#### Moraliskt argument att service users ska tilldelas en röst i forskning som påverkar deras hälsa 

> Irrespective of whether relevance to society can be demonstrated, there is a moral argument that service users should have a voice in research which may have an impact on their health status (Boote et al., 2002). [305]

#### Forskare erfar vissa svårigheter med att låta service users formulera ansökningar

> ...in the interviews we conducted, researchers reported difﬁculties with involving service users in writing proposals because of not wanting to raise service users’ expectations that the research would be funded, or not having the time or resources to do this. [305]

#### Etiskt tvivelaktigt att bland in service users innan etikansökan beviljats

> There is also an unresolved research governance issue about whether or not it is acceptable to involve service users before ethical approval has been obtained. [305]

#### Samtidig verkar tidig service user involvement kunna hjälpa till att identifiera potentiella etiska problem innan de uppstår 

> Previous research ﬁndings indicate that involvement at this stage can help to identify potential  ethical issues before they arise (Entwistle et al., 2002). [305]

#### I utvecklandet av enkäter kan service user involvement leda till högre svarsfrekvens

> In researcher-led studies, service users have been involved in developing and piloting data collection tools, designing questionnaires and deciding how data will be collected. In questionnaire design this can help to validate the questionnaire in terms of the language being used, the appropriateness of the questions being asked and the method of collection, leading to improved response rates (Nicolson et al., 2001). [305]

#### Involving service users in dissemination of research findings can have a powerful impact and make findings more accessible

> The literature suggests that involving service users in the dissemination of research ﬁndings, for example co-presenting a paper at a conference, can have a powerful impact and can make ﬁndings more accessible (see for example, Liberty et al., 1999; Flaskerud and Anderson, 1999). [306]

#### Involvement can have therapeutic outcomes for service users

> Policy documents and the research literature claim that there can be beneﬁts for service users who are involved in research (for example, DH, 2004; Baxter etal., 2001; Dixon et al., 1999). Such outcomes have beendescribed as therapeutic, and can be related to concepts of altruism (Agrawal, 2003). Accounts of research studies show that participation has helped some patients with cancer to construct their lives with greater meaning by providing a supportive structure and enabling hope (Moore, 2001).

#### Involving service users requires building greater flexibility into projects
> Involving service users requires building greater flexibility into projects, particularly in relation to timescales and the provision of additional support (Faulkner, 2004).

#### New forms of partnerships with service users in research raise new and different ethical issues

> The review found that new forms of partnerships with service users in research raise new and different ethical issues in relation to conﬁdentiality, anonymity, informed consent and protection from harm. Where service users are involved as co-researchers or active members of project teams there is a need to consider ethical issues both on the part of service users and to protect other participants in the research.
