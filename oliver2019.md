# Notes on Oliver, K., Kothari, A., & Mays, N. (2019): The dark side of coproduction: do the costs outweigh the benefits for health research?


2020-01-24
Den här artikeln var en referens som användes i en fallstudie om _knowledge transformation_ som Oskar och Lennart gjort och beskrivit. Den utgjorde ämne för ett UserAge-seminarium 24/1.

Jag fann följande avsnitt intressanta med tanke på mitt eget arbete och min kamp att bedriva forskning av det här slaget:

> "Coproduction is an exciting approach to research that can generate truly novel, unexpected outputs [19]. However, it takes investment, skills, time and courtesy. Engaging stakeholders should be done for the right reasons and in the right way [52], yet there is so little empirical evidence about how coproduction changes research, policy or practice, or how it may compare to alternatives." 


> "We suggest that a cautious approach to coproduction would include examining the costs and benefits to all involved, recognising the significant costs and risks to investing time and resources into good facilitation and management of expectations, establishing ground rules and processes, and deciding on evidence-informed strategies to achieve established and shared aims and outcomes. Below, we summarise some key questions which we believe all those involved in coproduction should ask themselves prior to attempting any engagement. 

> Individual researchers, funders, commissioners and participants in the research process should ask themselves:
     
    1. What is everyone bringing to the table? For example, policy-makers and funders bring money,knowledge of the political context, pressure for answers; researchers bring topic and methodological expertise; public and patients bring their experiences.

    2. Under which circumstances are these needed, for what purpose, and at which stage of the research process? For example, when is it better to have patient representatives articulate the user perspective rather than derive understanding from a systematic review of patient experiences? Should policy-makers be involved all the way through, or only at specific stages?

    3. What are the costs? How will the time, administrative, cultural and professional costs be borne and defrayed by those involved?

    4. How are decisions taken, and how will responsibility and accountability be shared? Will group dynamics, market forces, authority or some other decision-making process control the process? How will this be governed and managed?

> Research organisations and funders need to consider:

    1. How to create (co-create) and support the infrastructure and leadership for coproduction

    2. How to provide training in coproduction, and help researchers and funders take this seriously as a skill set

    3. How to reward good practice, and to recognise the work coproduction may take even if it does not lead to impact

    4. How to evaluate the potential impact(s) of coproduction

    5. How to ensure that coproduction supports, rather than mitigates against diversity and quality in research and policy
