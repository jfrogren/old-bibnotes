Här argumenterar H för att housing är ett alltför spretigt område för att det ska kunna gå att skapa en allomfattande teori om housing:

> The basic reason for being suspect about theory of housing (v1) is that housing itself is not a research topic but a common denominator of a number of research topics: housing policy, housing provision, housing organizations, housing choice, housing mobility, housing tenures, uses and meanings of housing, housing inequalities, and more. There is no one “theoretical object”. Rather there are many theoretical objects linked with housing, and theorizing them is more or less connected with theoretical debates elsewhere. There is little hope for uniting all of these into a single theoretical framework although brave attempts are now and then made (see McNelis 2016). It is sensible to theorize the different housing topics with different concepts and ideas, drawing theoretical resources from disciplines and related research ﬁelds. And I would not rule out philosophical contemplation, conceptual analysis and grounded theorization of the housing phenomenon from the resources available in theorizing about housing-related topics. [@ruonavaara2018, p. 187].

Här kan jag i min artikel ta fasta på att "It is sensible to theorize the different housing topics with different concepts and ideas, drawing theoretical resources from disciplines and related research ﬁelds." Just att det kan finnas ett behov av teori som inte gör anspråk på att rama in alla aspekter av housing men att fokusera på en del av housing och utgå från det.


> In many cases, the issue is that research on housing can just as well be seen as belonging in some more general ﬁeld. For example, a great deal of recent research on home ownership in Europe and Australia has focused on housing equity: how // quity is made use of by owner-occupiers (Naumanen and Ruonavaara 2016), how equity is distributed between different social groups (Norris and Winston 2012), to what extent households perceive housing wealth as providing security at old age (Naumanen, Perista, and Ruonavaara 2012), whether governments are starting to reformulate welfare policies towards housing asset-based welfare (Doling and Ronald 2010). These questions have centrally to do with housing and therefore, they can be seen to fall into the scope of housing research. However, some of these questions can just as well be seen as belonging to more established and more general subﬁelds of social sciences, such as economic sociology, as well as to research on inequality: the behaviour of households with regard to housing equity and the unequal distribution of housing assets. The question of whether there is a trend towards housing asset-based welfare provision or not is equally a part of a more general analysis of trends in welfare provision, falling within the purview of social policy (in my own country a distinct discipline from sociology) or political sociology.

Med andra ord argumenteras det här för att forskning om housing ofta kan sägas utgöra del av en forskning som handlar om något större såsom rättvisa eller hälsa... I vårt fall är det väl hälsa just! det är bosäder som en väg till hälsa... och då är accessibility centralt
