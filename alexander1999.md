## Good environments are generic - every part is adapted to its particularities

> How could one possibly get a hold of all the massive amount of construction that is taking place on Earth and, somehow, make it well, that means let it be generated in a good fashion and a living fashion? This decision to use a genetic approach was not only because of the scale problem. It was important from the beginning, because one of the characteristics of any good environment is that every part of it is extremely highly adapted to its particularities. That local adaptation can happen successfully only if people (who are locally knowledgeable) do it for themselves. In traditional society where lay people either built or laid out their own houses, their own streets, and so on, the adaptation was natural. It occurred successfully because it was in the hands of the people that were directly using the buildings and streets. [@alexander1999, p. 74]

## The pattern language

> The pattern language that we began creating in the 1970s had other essential features. First, it has a moral component. Second, it has the aim of creating coherence, morphological coherence in the things which are made with it. And third, it is generative: it allows people to create coherence, morally sound objects, and encourages and enables this process because of its emphasis on the coherence of the created whole. [@alexander1999, p. 74]


> Take the moral component, for example. In the architectural pattern language there is, at root, behind the whole thing, a constant preoccupation with the question, Under what circumstances is the environment good? In architecture that means something. It means something important and vital that goes, ultimately, to the nature of human life. [@alexander1999, p. 74]

> The moral preoccupation with the need for a good environment, and for the living structure of built environment, and the objective nature of that question, is largely accepted. [@alexander1999, p. 74]

> One of the things we looked for was a profound impact on human life. We were able to judge patterns, and tried to judge them, according to the extent that when present in the environment we were confident that they really do make people more whole in themselves. [@alexander1999, p. 75]

> A second, almost more important thing was going on. Whenever we had a language under development we always asked ourselves, To what extent does that language generate (hence produce) entities (buildings, rooms, groups of buildings, neighborhoods, etc.) that are whole and coherent? [@alexander1999, p. 75]

> as a lay person trying to read some of the works that have been published by you in this field, it looks to me more as though mainly the pattern concept, for you, is an inspiring format that is a good way of exchanging fragmentary, atomic ideas about programming. Indeed, as I understand it, that part is working very well. But these other two dimensions, (1) the moral capacity to produce a living structure and (2) the generativity of the thing, its capability of producing coherent wholes—I haven’t seen very much evidence of those two things in software pattern theory. Are these your shortcomings? Or is it just because I don’t know how to read the literature? [@alexander1999, p. 75]

> when we and others were using these patterns to generate buildings, the buildings generated were okay but not profound. There was often a lot of nice stuff going on in them. People were improving certain features, perhaps the daylight was improved, or perhaps the entrance of a building was improved or the characteristics of a street might be improved or an alcove in a bedroom might make it more intimate or something like this. So, there were various isolated features of buildings that were improvements in building performance. The existence of the patterns also allowed people to have better control over their own environment. It succeeded in embodying that control in the real buildings that they made with the pattern material. That was good. But, nevertheless, were the buildings profound structures? To what extent did they really have coherent living structure as wholes? [@alexander1999, p. 75]

> It seemed to me that we had fallen far short of the mark that I had intended. But, I also realized that whatever was going wrong wasn’t going to be corrected by writing a few more patterns or making the patterns a little bit better. There seemed to be something more fundamental that was missing from the pattern language. So, I started looking for what that thing was. [@alexander1999, p. 75]

## The 15 deep properties 

> At about the same time I began to notice a // deeper level of structure and a small number (15) of geometric properties that appeared to exist recursively in space whenever buildings had life. These 15 properties seemed to define a more fundamental kind of stuff; similar to the patterns we had defined earlier, but more condensed, more essential — some kind of stuff that all good patterns were made of. [@alexander1999, p. 75-76]

> around this time (late ’70s, early ’80s), my colleagues and I began toughening up our ability to discriminate empirically between living structure and not living structure. [...] we felt it was pretty important to get a fix on the difference between a chair which has a more living structure and a chair that has a less living structure. And the same for a building or a room or for a main street in a town. If you want to say this one has life, this one has less life, how do you say that with any degree of empirical certainty? Can it, in fact, be made a relatively objective matter which people can agree about if they perform the same experiments? [@alexander1999, p. 76]

> Indeed, we did find such experimental techniques. The use of these techniques greatly sharpened our ability to distinguish what was really going on and what structures then correlated with the presence of life in a bit of the environment. The use of these techniques also helped us to refine the 15 deep geometric properties, as necessary correlates of all life in designed structures. These 15 properties turned out to be a substrate of all patterns, and began showing up more and more clearly in our work as the main correlates of living structure in places, buildings, things, space, and so forth. [@alexander1999, p. 76]

Man blir minst sagt rätt nyfiken på dessa 15 mönster! Sedan går han in och förklarar att många arkitekter inte menar att det finns någon objektivitet eller sanning på det sätt som Alexander gör gällande men det menar han att det finns.

## Functionality correlates with sense of 'wholeness'

>As a whole, the way a parking lot works is essentially a technical thing. The question is, Is it working well or not well? And yet the functionality of the thing measured by these various ordinary bits of technical discussion correlates with the condition measured by the question, Do I feel myself to be more whole? It works well when you are getting a positive answer to this question. Thus there is a hint of a profound connection between the nature of matter and behavior of material systems, and the human person. [@alexander1999, p. 77]

> the behavior of material systems in the world, is somehow at the same time coming home more and more and more, all the time, into the person. The life that is actually in the thing is correlated in some peculiar fashion with the condition of wholeness in ourselves when we are in the presence of that thing. [@alexander1999, p. 77]

> in architecture — this is not merely a hunch but a testable empirical result. [@alexander1999, p. 77]

> At the root of these 15 properties, there appears to be a recursive structure based on repeated appearances of a single type of entity—the primitive element of all wholeness. These entities are what I call ‘centers.’All wholeness is built from centers, and centers are recursively defined in terms of other centers. Centers have life, or not, in different degree, according to the degree that the centers are built from other // centers using the 15 geometric relationships which I have identified. This scheme, which is at the foundation of all the work in The Nature of Order, provides a complete and coherent picture of all living structure. [@alexander1999, p. 77-78]

> Centers are field-like structures that appear in some region of space. They don’t have sharp boundaries, but they are the focal organizing entities that one perceives at the core of all pattern, all structure, and all wholeness. [@alexander1999, p. 78]

> Everything is made of these kinds of centers. The centers are more living or less living. And, that’s essentially the only important property that they have. And the question of whether a center is more living or less living depends recursively on the amount of livingness in the other centers that it is made of, because each living center is always (and can only be defined as) a structure of other centers. [@alexander1999, p. 78]

## Processes generating living structure

> Once we have the view of wholeness and centers, linked by the 15 deep properties, we have a general view of the type of whole which must occur as the end product of any successful design process. And because we have a view of it as a whole, we are now able to understand what kinds of overall process can generate good structure, and which cannot. [@alexander1999, p. 78]

> what are the rules of its production? The answer is fascinating. It turns out that these living structures can only be produced by an unfolding wholeness. That it, there is a condition in which you have space in a certain state. You operate on it through things that I have come to call ‘structure-preserving transformations,’maintaining the whole at each step, but gradually introducing differentia-//tions one after the other. And if these transformations are truly structure-preserving and structure-enhancing, then you will come out at the end with living structure. Just think of an acorn becoming an oak. The end result is very different from the start point but happens in a smooth unfolding way in which each step clearly emanates from the previous one. [@alexander1999, p. 78-79]

> Very abstract, I know, but the punchline is the following. That is what happens in all the living structures we think of as nature. When you analyze carefully just what’s going on and how things are happening in the natural world, this sort of structure-preserving transformation tends to be what’s going on most of the time. That is why, when nature is left alone, most of the time living structure is produced. [@alexander1999, p. 79]

> If a process doesn’t go in the structure-preserving way that I’m talking about, the result is never living structure. [@alexander1999, p. 79]

Hur flummigt det än är så är det ju oerhört intressant och låter rimligt. Handlar det alltså om att låta saker växa fram organiskt? Är det det som han försöker säga? Jag blir nyfiken på det.

## Current processes often create lifeless structure

> However, in the approaches that we currently have to the creation of the built world and the environment (planning design, construction, and so forth), that is simply not what is happening. The process of design that we currently recognize as normal is one where the architect or somebody else is sort of moving stuff around, trying to get into some kind of good configuration. Effectively this means searching in an almost random way in configuration space, and never homing in on the good structure. That is why the present-day structure of cities, buildings, conventional halls, and houses are so often lifeless. The processes by which they are generated are — in principle — not life creating or life seeking. [@alexander1999, p. 79]

## Arkitekter och nuvarande arbetsprocesser kommer inte klara av att bygga i tillräckligt takt mha nuvarande processer

Alexander går vidare och blickar framåt han ser ett problem i den mängd "constructed, designed space" som behöver byggas. Han skriver:

> All the architects in the world, together, working as they do today, cannot design more than say 10 10 square feet per year—a tiny, tiny percentage of what is needed—far too small to be effective. [@alexander1999, p. 79]

Man blir lite fundersam hur han så självklart kan komma fram med den siffran och med det tvärsäkra konstaterandet, men hursomhelst. Vad ska man då göra om det är som han säger?

## Lösningen på hur vi kan bygga living structure i tillräcklig snabb takt

Alexander menar att det krävs en "genetic" approch för detta och skriver så här:

> I have, for many years, thought that this could only be solved by a genetic approach — an approach where deep structure, spread through society, creates and generates the right sort of structure, very much as genetic code creates and generates organisms and ecological systems — indirectly, by letting loose life-creating process. That is what I still believe. But, today, I am convinced that the equivalent of the genes that act in organisms will have to be — or at least can be — software packages, acting in society. If these software // packages are life creating, and accepted, and widely enough spread throughout the world, there is a chance we might get a grip on this problem: provided that the software is freeing, liberating, allows each person individual control and decision making power to do the right thing, and to create living structure, locally, wherever they are. [@alexander1999, p. 79-80]

Software packages och en approch som utgår från det lokala... ser han som en potentiell lösning. Han är kanske inte helt fel ute, men jag tänker AI, open source och möjligtvis 3D-skrivare... problemet återstår väl dock kring hur arbetet ska organiseras.

## Hur sprida budskapet effektivt om hur man bygger living structure

Alexander frågar sig hur denna kunskap kan spridas så att vi i större utsträckning kan omges av "living structure". Han säger sig att genom att informera computer scientists (i Silicon Valley 1996!) så ser han en potential i att sprida budskapet eftersom dessa med tanke på den revolution som bara påbörjats inom datorisering och digitalisering:

> because it is you who control the function of computers and their programs. It is the programs that control the shape of manufacturing, the shape of the transportation industries, construction management, diagnosis in medicine, printing and publishing. You almost can’t name a facet of the world which is not already, to some very strong degree, under the influence of the programs that are being written to manage and control those entities or those operations. And this is still in its infancy. [...] this is quite new. It is going to look a whole lot different, even more powerful in its degree of influence. [@alexander1999, p. 80]

Snacka om att han såg rätt klokt på saken.

## Similarities and differences between generative schemes and coding

> We are now focusing on pattern languages which are truly generative. That means, they are sequences of instructions which allow a person to make a complete, coherent building, by following the steps of the generative scheme. [...] in _A Pattern Language_, these generative schemes are much more like what you call code. They are generative processes which are defined by sets of instructions that produce or generate designs. They are, in fact, systems of instructions which allow unfolding to occur in space in just the way that I was talking about a minute ago (Part 2), and are therefore more capable of producing living structure [...] The new generative languages are dynamic and, like software, interact with context, to allow people to generate an infinite variety of possible results—but, in this case, with a built-in guarantee of well-formed results. The design that is created or generated is guaranteed, ahead of time, to be coherent, useful, and to have living structure.[@alexander1999, p. 81]


## Pattern language based on generative schemes in traditional cultures

> When I first constructed the pattern language, it was based on certain generative schemes that exist in traditional cultures. These generative schemes are sets of instructions which, carried out sequentially, will allow a person or a group of people to create a coherent artifact, beautifully and simply. The number of steps vary: there may be as few as half a dozen steps, or as many as 20 or 50. When the generative scheme is carried out, the results are always different, because the generative scheme always generates structure that starts with the existing context, and creates things which relate directly and specifically to that context. Thus the beautiful organic variety which was commonplace in traditional society could exist because these generative schemes were used by thousands of different people, and allowed people to create houses, or rooms, or windows, unique to their circumstances. [@alexander1999, p. 81]
