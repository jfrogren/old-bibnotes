# Notes on Davies et al. (2010) - Engaging the oldest old in research: lessons from the newcastle 85+ study

#### Rationale

> In order to guarantee that the future care provided to our ageing populations is grounded in the best quality evidence, it is imperative that researchers ensure their study populations are representative and include the oldest old, the most rapidly expanding sector of the population.

> Older people, especially those over 75 and those in care homes, are often unjustifiably excluded from studies [ref. 24-26].

#### Syfte

> In this paper, we report some of the challenges of, and successful strategies for, involving, recruiting and retaining this important age group [= Those aged 85 and over = the oldest old] in research studies.


#### Resultat

De listar följande challenges och successful strategies:

- **Initial participant approach**. An initial invitation
from a known health care professional may lead to
more confusion than a letter from the study team.
Photographs of researchers are useful additions to
study information sheets. Adequate time for recruit-
ment and data collection should be factored into
planning.

- **Engagement with family and care home staff**.
Additional time and resources are needed, especially
with the oldest old, to engage with family carers and
other gatekeepers such as care home staff for those
people living in care. Researchers should be trained
and supported to ensure that complex situations are
handled with sensitivity.

- **Significant cognitive impairment is an issue**;
due consideration must been given to the relevant
ethical and legal issues, including assessment of
capacity and consent procedures. The use of pro-
tocols to assess capacity and to secure consent
should be developed. Training for researchers in the
assessment of capacity and seeking informed consent
should be mandatory.

- **Minimising participant burden**. Home visits are
preferred by this population and may enable the par-
ticipation of those who are frail or housebound.
Consequently researchers’ travel costs, specialised
portable equipment and availability of chaperones
may need to be costed into the research. The need
for, and the cost of, several, shorter visits to assess
capacity, secure consent and collect all relevant data
should be anticipated.

- **Participant withdrawal**. Researchers should
endeavour to make the research process as flexible
as possible and may wish to consider the option of
study suspension as an alternative to withdrawal as
often the participant does not wish to withdraw per-
manently but cannot accommodate study visits at
that particular time due to other commitments.

- **Communication with participants after study
cessation**. The oldest old may derive benefits, such
as opportunities for increased socialisation, from
participation in research. The process of study close-
out should be considered at the onset so that partici-
pants are not left with a feeling of loss. A communi-
cation strategy to update participants about the
study progress and findings after their involvement
ceases can be helpful.

- **Engagement with stakeholders and the media**.
Researchers should consider the need to engage with
not only local clinicians, but also with older people’s
voluntary organisations, the media and the local
press. This should be proactively built into the study
recruitment protocol.
