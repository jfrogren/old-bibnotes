# Notes on Steinfeld, E., Danford, G. S., & Danford, G. (1999): Enabling environments: measuring the impact of environment on disability and rehabilitation


** Review
Målet med boken: Developing a theoretical foundation for accessibility.

** Definitions:
- Disability is viewed as an inability or limitation in performing a task and has a locus in the individual.
- Handicap, or the positive and easier to measure term "participation", is an outcome of the interaction between the person and the sociophysical environment. It has a locus in the environment. A disability is viewed as the functional limitation caused by an impairment, whereas lack of participation is caused by the response of a culture to disability. For example, prejudice toward hiring people with disabilities restricts participation in the labor force; a walking limitation does not inherently have such an impact.
- The ability of the person, defined by level of independence in a functional task, has improved through environmental intervention.

>"Although the existing knowledge base can be used to assess the accessibility of buildings, as defined by a design norm, it cannot easily be used to assess the degree to which environments actually enable from the perspective of individuals or groups with impairments" (p. 14)

- FIM instrument... is based on the theory that disability can be measured separately from the influence of environment...

MEN

> "Fine and Asch (1988) argue that a focus on the person to the exclusion of environment reinforces the stereotype of helplessness associated with disability" (p. 14)

>"A focus on environment as a mediating variable... recognizes the powerful role environment plays in the social construction of disability." (p.14)

I vilken utsträckning är DISABILITY en social konstruktion? Till viss del, men det finns också gränser för vad vi kan utkräva av miljön, eller?

- independant living movement
- philosophy of mainstreaming

Information om tillgängliga bostäder är av intresse för många olika aktörer. information that can be used ona case-by-case basis as part of rehabilitation  interventions is one example.

>"We need reliable methods to determine the specific needs of a person in a specific place."

>"We need instruments that measure the degree to which a physical environment disables or enables an individual or group."

That is what I am trying to create.
