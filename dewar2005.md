# Notes on Dewar, B. J. (2005) - Beyond tokenistic involvement of older people in research - a framework for future development and understanding

#### Rationale

> Research and development work in health and social care are increasingly required to involve users at all stages of the research process yet there is scant empirical evidence to support the justification of this laudable aim. Evidence does suggest that at present efforts to achieve this are primarily tokenistic and that more work is needed, both to examine what user involvement in research activity actually means, and how this can best be supported.


#### Syfte

> This paper sets out to describe developments to support involvement of older people through work at the Royal Bank of Scotland Centre for the Older Person’s Agenda and to identify a number of challenges that this has raised for researchers. These challenges have arisen out of a number of assumptions that underpin the process of user involvement. The paper discusses some of the benefits of working in partnership with older people and identifies strategic issues for consideration in order to promote future partnership working.

#### Några slutsatser och reflektioner av artikelförfattarna kring user involvement


##### Varför och hur aktiviteter utförs snarare än att de utförs  avgör graden av user involvement
> Authors have tried to unpick definitions of involvement by representing it as levels along a continuum. The consumer model of participation would sit at one end of the continuum, with an empowerment model at the other. The difficulty with representing user involvement in this way is that it defines involvement as a set of activities rather than addressing some of the principles that should guide involvement. It does not take into account key questions about the nature of relationships in the research process. [p. 51]

Bra reflektion. Istället för att att definiera graden av involvement baserat på vilken slags aktivitet det rör sig om bör fokus ligga på "the principles that should guide involvement" och "key questions about the nature of relationships in the research process" eftersom det är mer avgörande för graden av engagemang. Det de vill poängtera här är att graden av user involvement avgörs inte blott av att du gör en viss aktivitet utan varför och hur du utför den på ett visst sätt.

##### Can research be done by anyone and can we disregard the experiences of the researcher?

> Is it true that everyone can do research? If so why do we spend money and effort preparing academics to learn and gain extensive experience in this activity? What does doing research with users actually mean? Is everyone doing the same thing? It is not clear in the literature what is exactly meant by involvement of users in research. [p. 51]

En högst relevant fråga. Dock har artikeln några år på nacken vilket gör det tveksamt om det är lämpligt att referera till att detta utgör det nuvarande kunskapsläget.

##### Dangerous to assume that older people want control over the research process rather than for example a partnership
> Literature that has identified different models of involvement and has described various levels of involvement ranging from // seeking views at one end to empowerment of older people who in turn have control over research at the other. When this is presented as a ladder (for example Hoyes & Means, 1993; Reed et al., 2004), the empowerment model sits at the top, implying that this is the gold standard in partnership/involvement activity. Few of these models have been developed with older people and it would be dangerous to assume that older people want control over the research process rather than for example a partnership, where knowledge and skills of all parties are shared and valued. There is no evidence to suggest that research made by older people has better outcomes than research made in partnership. [p. 51-52]

##### Det finns oklarheter kring vad som egentligen motiverar äldre att vara med i forskning och vilken form av lärande de egentligen får ut av ett sådant engagemang

> The motivation to become involved in research and development activities is not always clear. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the drivers for older people’s motivation to become involved include: wanting to give something back to their communities; wanting stimulation; having time on their hands; and wanting to make a difference. The emphasis in this evidence lies more heavily in the ‘giving’ domain rather than the receiving. Does this mean that only certain people will become involved in such an activity? What is the link between this motivation to become involved and where the power driving the activity ultimately lies? Gilbert (2004, p. 306) argues that ‘the power relationships remain stacked in favour of the professionals who retain specialist knowledge and value positions’. More attention needs to be paid to reciprocity and a commitment to learning in the process of involvement in research and development. [p. 52]

#### Six key issues emerged needed to be considered in the development of any programme of involvement

> By considering these assumptions six key issues emerged that needed to be considered in the development of any programme of involvement:

+ adopt a systematic approach to recording the processes and
outcomes of involvement with older people – remain crit-
ical – be open to the possibility that it may not be a good
thing;
+ consider a set of principles rather than levels of involve-
ment that are important to guide the process. These prin-
ciples must emphasize equality and fairness, a clear sense of
purpose and roles, and a commitment to learning;
+ debate what the role of the older person in the partnership
process is, and what skills they may therefore need;
+ work with older people to explore their beliefs and values
underpinning research and learning;
+ work with older people to explore what type of partnership
they want;
+ consider techniques and approaches to involvement that
would promote equal partnerships.


#### Övriga reflektioner och tankar framåt

> Formalizing the role of older people who work in partnership with the Centre to be one of ‘associate’ would enable them to have a formal role within the Centre and be offered regular opportunities to use their knowledge and skills in practice.

Detta är ju något som vi på CASE har gjort genom vårt brukarråd.

> Education programmes for professionals on how to facilitate involvement need to be developed. It should not be assumed that this is easy and that facilitators do not need support in developing these complex skills. In addition there needs to be a change in attitude of professionals towards partnership working with older people whereby professionals need to recognize the potential research expertise of users and to work with this.

Detta ovan  är viktigt. Bara för att vi är professorer och forskare betyder det inte att även vi måste lära oss vissa skills för att detta ska fungera. Vi måste också reflektera över hur jämlika relationerna egentligen är mellan oss och de som vi involverar. 

> Further development of theory that guides involvement is a priority. At present much of the theory that guides practice in relation to involvement is based on different levels of involvement in the partnership process. Theory, however, does not address the different types of support that are required at these levels, nor does it reflect organizational and process issues inherent in involvement (Reed et al., 2004).

(Se citat ovan) Vad krävs det för typ av stöd för att utföra involvering på en viss nivå eller på ett viss sätt som säkerställer att uppgiften utförs på ett inkluderande och bra sätt. Här saknas kunkap, men man får ha i åtanke att artikeln är rätt gammal nu.

> Exploring the concept of ‘equal but different partners’ is necessary. Professionals and service users bring different knowledge and skills to the process of partnership working. The contributions need to be more fully explored if we are to provide appropriate support that develops service users’ ‘different’ contribution. More work need to be carried out on exploring methods that challenge the power relations within the research process.

Hur kan vi komplettera varandras kompetenser på ett bra sätt och hur säkerställer vi att maktrelationerna är rättvisa? Här behövs mer forskning

> Evaluation of both the processes and outcomes of older people in carrying out research is required. Little is known in the field of older research about the collective and individual outcomes yet it is advocated by many, as an essential process if we are to make services more responsive to the needs of older people. Beresford (2003b, p. 57) poses the important question when referring to the way forward with research in this area when he asks, ‘Is knowledge produced from research with users more realistic and authentic than research made without this contribution?’

Vad bidrar egentligen äldre personer med genom att engagera sig på detta sätt? Vad bidrar de med som kollektiv och som individer? Detta tror jag att det idag finns mycket forskning som beskriver även om det inte fanns det när denna artikel skrevs.

> More opportunities need to be created for the sharing of experiences about the process of involvement in research and development work. There is a need to explore the common ground that exists between different groups, e.g. disabled people, people with mental health issues, people with learning disabilities. A fuller understanding is required in relation to barriers to involvement, how to overcome // these, and whether there are some that still need to be acknowledged

Mindra silos och mer lära av varandra från angränsande områden kring vad som utgör hinder för involvering av olika grupper t.ex. personer med olika funktionshinder.

De tar även om att forskningsfinansieräer måste bli mer varse att involvering kräver resurser och att etiknämnder inte behöver vara så stelbenta i sina godkännanden utan mer flexibla och se möjligheter med involvering och vad det kan ge de som involveras.
