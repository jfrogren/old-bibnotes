# Notes on Oldenhof, L., & Wehrens, R. (2018) - Who is ‘in’and who is ‘out’? participation of older persons in health research and the interplay between capital, habitus and field

#### Community engagement

Här pratas om 'community engagement' som begrepp (dock utan att någon tydlig definition ges) och författarna skriver att:

> Community engagement has developed into a widespread policy ideal that is viewed as intrinsically good as it promises democratic decision-making, empowerment and legitimacy (Bensing, 2000; Boote, Telford, & Cooper, 2002; Hanley, Truesdale, King, Elbourne, & Chalmers, 2001; Van de Bovenkamp, Trappenburg,& Grit, 2009). [p. 281]

Vilken form antar då detta engagemang? Jo, så här skriver författarna:

> This ideal has been translated into various formats and governance structures, such as patient councils, community membership of ethics committees and funding boards (Van de Bovenkamp et al., 2009). [p. 281]

#### Risker med implementeringen av 'community engagement'

> Despite the inclusive promise of engagement, however, risks of community exploitation and exclusion of patient perspectives are still pervasive (Gbadegesin & Wendler, 2006). [p. 281]

Fokuset för att identifiera riskerna  och hitta strategier för att minska dem har enligt författarna so far antingen legat på *individual agency* (och att som ett motmedel mot det försöka göra patienter och communities mer 'health literate') eller *organizational structures* (där då fokus legat på organisatoriska "facilitators and barriers that enable or limit inclusive participation (e.g. staff capacity, financial resources and accountability requirements)"). 

#### Samspelet mellan 'individual agency' och 'organizational structures' är inte tillräckligt studerat

Dock menar författarna att...

> ...there is still too little attention for a more detailed analysis of the interplay between individual agency and organizational structures in how inclusion and exclusion are shaped in mundane practices. [p. 282]

#### Strategi för att studera samspelet mellan 'individual agency' och 'organizational structures'

Och för att bättre studera detta använder de sig av följande strategi:

> To better capture this dynamic interplay, we use the Bourdieusian framework of capital, habitus and field to analyse how inclusion and exclusion are processually shaped. This framework makes visible the relations between institutional context, embedded work routines and individual decisions of actors. Additionally, we use the concept of ‘micro-advantages’ (Gengler, 2014) to show how the mobilization of capital can result in subtle advantages vis-à-vis other participating actors. [p. 282]

#### Det case på vilket denna strategi ska appliceras

De applicerar denna strategi på följande case:

> We analyse a Dutch case of target group participation in the National Program of Elderly Care (NPEC). This programme aims to improve the quality of care for frail older persons with multiple conditions by the development of (1) regional networks for care and research, in which target group panels (consisting of older persons) were positioned as important network partners; (2) transition experiments and research projects to improve the quality of care; (3) the implementation of new interventions in medical care and public health. In each, older persons were actively encouraged to participate in the evaluation, design and implementation of research and interventions. [p. 282]

#### Resultat av analysen

> The analysis showed the influence of established fields (medical and policy) on how participation of older persons was shaped in the beginning of the programme, leading to the inclusion of persons with specific forms of social capital and the exclusion of persons lacking this capital. The rules of engagement turned out to be hard to change. Even older persons with much social and cultural capital had difficulties in participating, leading to an increasing recognition that their perspective was used instrumentally. Members of the target group panels developed different strategies to respond to these difficulties. Overall, the voice of community members gradually led to substantive changes in the programme. The strategies of professionalization and responsibilization led to increased social, cultural and symbolic capital for particular groups, along with the obtainment of further micro-advantages. The downside is that participants lacking the right capital face ‘micro-disadvantages’ as a consequence of the highly specialized and professional field in which they were operating. [p. 291]

#### Vad kan man enligt artikelförfattarna ta med sig utifrån denna analys tillbaka in i den praktiska verkligheten?

Jo, följande:

> There is a growing recognition that attention for ethics and politics are crucial for the development of ‘good’ community engagement practices in research. This is evidenced by the increasing number of ethical guidelines for community engagement (Lavery et al., 2010). Yet the impact of these guidelines on biomedical research has been modest (Hasnida et al., 2017; Lavery et al., 2010). Our Bourdieusian framework offers an explanation why ethical guidelines in themselves are insufficient for guaranteeing inclusive engagement. A strongly established institutional field of global health research funding leaves marginalized actors with the need to perform continuous work to have their voices taken seriously. In order to change this, we need more than just ethical guidelines and entrepreneurial individuals. Institutional work needs to be conducted on many levels, including the level of funding (creating new funding structures), research (establishing and maintaining local research infrastructures) and community (new tools and instruments for the embedding of experience-based knowledge can strengthen the capital needed for inclusive engagement). [p. 291]

#### Slutord från artikelförfattarna

> Our analysis shows that inclusion and exclusion are not static terms but processes that change in the course of a programme. Institutional contexts and disciplinary routines have a major influence on the ways participation is shaped, and it takes time and skill to incrementally change these contexts. We conclude that it is by definition impossible to ‘exclude exclusion’ at the start of care improvement programmes. It is only in the many pragmatic and mundane choices of ‘doing participation’ that exclusion and inclusion practices are shaped. Research would therefore benefit from a processual approach in which these mundane practices are followed overtime. Participation is ongoing work and never finished. [p. 292]
