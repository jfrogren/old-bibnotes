# Notes on Asokan, R. (2019): A new look at ritwik ghatak’s bengal

> "The Partition of Bengal looms large over the cinema of Ritwik Ghatak. In eight grave, ravishing films, made in an intermittent career that spanned the first three decades of Indian independence, he returned time and again to the calamitous event, which had deeply scarred him."

> "In all his films, and particularly the Partition Trilogy, the new nation is presented as something fractured, unstable, permeated with violence, and doomed from the outset. The contrast with Ray—see his glowing Apu Trilogy—could not be starker."

> "Ghatak’s pessimism is already evident in his third film, The Runaway (1959). It is the story of a child who flees his drearyvillage and tyrannical schoolmaster father to wander through Calcutta."

> "Ghatak’s most comprehensive statement about independent India is to be found in the great Partition Trilogy, shot between 1960 and 1962. In these films, he uses the vehicle of a marginal figure, the refugee, to tackle the social ills eating at the heart of Indian society. The Cloud-Capped Star (1960) is a fervid, Dostoyevskian tale of a young woman who allows herself to be exploited by her conservative family. E-Flat (1961) is a parable about the collapse of political idealism. Subarnarekha (1962), perhaps Ghatak’s best-known film, directly confronts caste."

> "Ghatak found realism woefully inadequate for depicting the brutality of Indian society. Instead, he fashioned a special kind of melodrama to convey how Hinduism deformed the lives of men and (particularly) women, constraining them in fixed social roles, circumscribing their aspirations. In all his films, he works with familiar, even cliché Indian types—spoiled son, vicious mother-in-law, long-suffering daughter, and so forth—only to unsettle them, subjecting his characters to a series of moral and intellectual challenges."

> "This interrogation plays out most powerfully in Cloud-Capped Star (1960), the story of a refugee family in Calcutta. The film is focused on Neeta, the oldest of four siblings, who single-handedly keeps the family solvent, while everyone else—vain sister, childish brothers, cruel mother, and hapless father—shamelessly sponge off her."

> "Cloud-Capped Star also showcases Ghatak’s predilection for mythic allusions. Raiding the cultural treasure chest of Hinduism, both its high Vedic and folk strains, he litters the film with images, songs, and motifs, creating an elaborate web of references, almost another level of storytelling, rather in the manner of T.S. Eliot in The Wasteland."

> "he uses wide-angle lenses that emphasize the depth of field, almost embossing people against a backdrop, in the style of mannerist paintings. In crucial moments he uses extreme close-ups to make the actors’ heads seem to float and wobble in a space, underscoring the fractured sense of self. “Ghatak’s cinematic devices… give the figure in space this uneasy location,” the art critic Geeta Kapur has noted, “on the join as it were, between reality and irreality.”

> “With our common habit of describing cinema as a visual art,” he wrote in his brilliant essay “Sound in Cinema,” “we are tending to forget altogether the importance of the world of sound byitself.”

> "All his films, with the exception of Cloud-Capped Star, were out-and-out box-office flops, which is unsurprising since little money was put into marketing them"

> "critics on the left denounced Ghatak for bourgeois pessimism and decadence, charges he repeatedly and vainly denied in print. Early in his career he took to drinking heavily; by the mid-1960s, he was an inveterate alcoholic [...] “Keep a bottle of liquor in one pocket and your childhood in another,” he advised young directors."

> "Ghatak’s films are a reminder of how badly the country is doing, and what it might have been. “This stuff you write, only sadness, struggles, and tears. I don’t like it,” someone tells Abhiram, a young lower-caste writer, in Subarnarekha. Abhiram smiles, then replies, “But this is what I see all around.”
