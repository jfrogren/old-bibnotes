# Notes on Perkins et al. (2019) - A formative qualitative evaluation to inform implementation of a research participation enhancement and advocacy training program for diverse seniors: the dreams program

#### Studiens syfte
Här handlar det om...

> a formative qualitative evaluation conducted to identify potential barriers and facilitators prior to implementation of a two-part educational intervention designed to increase older adults’ participation in clinical research.

Alltså att utvärdera en intervention (i form av en slags utbildning) för att öka äldre personers deltagande i klinisk forskning. Det är ju inte riktigt mitt område men det kan vara intressant ändå.

#### Slutsatser

##### Fear and mistrust of researchers and research
> Findings from thematic analysis showed that common barriers to research participation included older adults’ fear and mistrust of researchers and the medical community as well as misperceptions and negative attitudes about clinical research. A commonly held belief was that most clinical research is conducted by “greedy” pharmaceutical companies who are more interested in profits than finding cures for disease.

Alltså visar studien att ett vanligt hinder för att delta i klinisk forskning är äldre personers rädsla och misstro mot forskare och 'the medical community' liksom felaktiga föreställnngar och negativa attityder gentemot klinisk forskning som anses gå ut på mer att tjäna pengar åt medicinföretag än hitta botemodel mot sjukdomar.

Detta är ju intressant eftersom denna studie kan jag referera till och använda som motivation till att vi ställer frågor i enkäten om förtroende för forskare och forskningen.

Vidare skriver artikelförfattarna:

> Similar to previous research investigating barriers to research participation among racial and ethnic minority populations (Scharff et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2010), we found that fear and attitudes of mistrust related to the Tuskegee Syphilis Study were strong recurring themes across SES groups, particularly among African American participants.

Denna studie läste jag om i en tidigare artikel som utgörande en bakgrund till varför Participatory research lanserades.

> In line with previous research (Haley et al., 2017; Herrera et al., 2010), current findings also point to a need to develop more effective ways to communicate information regarding informed consent and study procedures, especially when enrolling participants with low levels of education. As noted by our SPs, this education needs to include better ways of helping participants understand the purpose of HIPAA language used in consent forms.

##### Ageism

> Another barrier we identified to recruiting older adults that has not received as much attention in the literature was perceived ageist attitudes of researchers and health professionals. Many older adults also complained about a general lack of respect, which included the belief that the real purpose of research studies and study findings is often withheld from study participants. Some indicated that being treated with respect as research partners was more important than receiving other types of incentives (i.e., money or food).

##### Perceiving  meaningful benefit - a facilitator to research participation

> Our findings and other recent findings (George et al., 2014; Hughes et al., 2017) show that an important facilitator to research participation is perceiving some meaningful benefit either personally or for the good of others.


##### Other barriers

> Other barriers to recruiting older adults that we identified and have been well documented in the literature (Manson, Tamim, & Baker, 2017; McHenry et al., 2012) included limited mobility, transportation issues, communication barriers, and competing interests.



#### Tidigare forskning


##### Older adults from low-income and racial and ethnic minorities underrepresented in research
> Older adults from low-income and racial and ethnic minority populations are particularly at risk of adverse health outcomes related to chronic illness and multimorbidity. These individuals have historically been underrepresented in research (Kaiser, Thomas, & Bowers, 2017; Purnell et al., 2016). [960]


##### Engagement of older adults from low-income and racial and ethnic minorities imperative to address growing diversity and health disparities
> Engagement of low-income and racial and ethnic minority older adults in research is imperative to address the growing diversity among and health disparities between older populations in the United States. [960]

##### Known barriers to research participation 
> Barriers to their research participation include distrust of the medical and research community, and fears related to a history of well-documented unethical research practices (Hughes, Varma, Pettigrew, & Albert, 2017; Williams et al., 2010), limited access and opportunities to participate, including stringent trial inclusion and exclusion criteria (Hamaker, Stauder, & van Munster, 2014; Herrera et al., 2010; Hughes et al., 2017), language and communication barriers (Haley et al., 2017; Larson, Cohn, Meyer, & Boden-Albala, 2009), ageism and physical health impairments (Hamaker et al., 2014; Herrera et al., 2010; Hughes et al., 2017), and consent challenges related to cognitive impairment or low health literacy (Haley et al., 2017; Herrera et al., 2010). Identifying barriers and facilitators to older adults’ research participation is vital to increasing their recruitment and retention in clinical studies as well as improving the quality of health care this group receives.

##### Importance of Patient and community input

> Patient and community input to research methods and interpretation are increasingly recognized as vital to developing patient-centered care, and have proven successful in the past to promote stakeholder buy-in and tailor studies involving diverse aging populations and multiple stakeholders to be culturally responsive (Idler, Grant, Quest, Binney, & Perkins, 2015; Manson et al., 2017; Mirk et al., 2016; Miyawaki, Belza, Kohn, & Petrescu-Prahova, 2018; Primetica, Menne, Bollin, Teri, & Molea, 2015).
