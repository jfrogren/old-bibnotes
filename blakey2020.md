# Notes on Blakey et al. (2020) - Involving older people in gerontological nursing research: a discussion of five european perspectives

EN doktorandartikel knappt värd namnet artikel skulle jag säga men det står lite om vilka statliga och regionala resurser som finns för participatorisk forskning i några olika europeiska länder. Det kanske kan vara bra att ha, jag vet inte.

#### The move to include patients and the public in health research began in oncology

#### Lack of emphasis in doctoral programmes about the importance of involving patients and the public in the research process and how this could be done

> there is a lack of emphasis in doctoral programmes about the importance of involving patients and the public in the research process and how this should be done. This may reduce the impact of nursing science and the quality of health and care long term. [p.4]
