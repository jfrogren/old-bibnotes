# Notes on Doucet, I., & Janssens, N. (2011): Transdisciplinary knowledge production in architecture and urbanism: towards hybrid modes of inquiry

## Foreword by Julie Thompson Klein

### Transdisciplinarity (TD) - first wide usage and definition
>"the term only came into wide use after 1972, in a book containing a typology created for the first international conference on interdisciplinary research and teaching in 1970. TD was defined as “a common system of axioms for a set of disciplines”, citing the example of anthropology conceived as the study of humans (OECD, 1972)." [v]

### Hybridisation in knowledge production
>"Observing the increased numbexr of hybrid formations, Dogan and Pahre (1995) proposed a theory of hybridisation. The first stage of the process, they argued, is specialisation, and the second stage is continuous reintegration of fragments of specialities across disciplines. Dogan and Pahre identified two types of hybrids. The first kind becomes institutionalised as a subfield of a discipline or as a permanent cross-disciplinary committee or program. The second kind remains informal. Hybrids often form in the gaps between subfields." [vi]

### Disciplinary and transdisciplinary research are complementary
>"The so-called “Mode 1” form of knowledge production does not need to be abandoned, but rather complemented by a new form of knowledge production that focuses on the combination of different types of knowledge. Such complementarity is also reflected in Basarab Nicolescu’s description of transdisciplinarity (Nicolescu, 2002, p. 45):_[T]ransdisciplinarity is nourished by disciplinary research; in turn, disciplinary research is clarified by transdisciplinary knowledge in a new and fertile way. In this sense, disciplinary and transdisciplinary research are not antagonistic but complementary_." [1]

### The three major elements of transdisciplinary knowledge production
>"there seems to be a strong sense of the kind of knowledge production at work. Namely, one that turns around three major elements: the integration of discipline and profession (theory and practice) in knowledge production, the ethical dimension, and the importance of experimental, designerly modes of inquiry." [2]

1. Integration of discipline and profession
2. The ethical dimension
3. The importance of experimental, designerly modes of inquiry

### Transdisciplinary research - one definition
>"The first two elements, integration of discipline and profession and the ethical dimension, are expressed in the first part of that definition (Pohl & Hirsch Hadorn, 2008, p. 431): "_[T]ransdisciplinary research is needed when knowledge about a societally relevant problem field is uncertain, when the concrete nature of problems is disputed, and when there is a great deal at stake for those concerned by problems and involved in dealing with them_." [2]

Det här handlar ju egentligen om vikten av att få med så många slags värden och värderingar som möjligt och att kunna göra en vettig avvägning mellan dessa olika värden och värderingar. Det är där etiken kommer in och det är därför den ses som så central.

### Design as the art of dealing with various kinds of knowledge
>"Wolfgang Jonas, in this respect, mentions that design is the art of dealing with scientific and non-scientific knowledge, with fuzzy knowledge, with outdated knowledge and with no knowledge at all (Jonas, 2003, p. 1)." [3]

### Interdisciplinary vs. transdisciplinary knowledge
>"whereas interdisciplinary knowledge is located in scholarly environments, transdisciplinary knowledge production entails a fusion of academic and non-academic knowledge, theory and practice, discipline and profession." [4]

### Transdisciplinarity as defined by Julie Thompson Klein
>"Julie Thompson Klein, outside the context of this book, has defined transdisciplinarity as the following (Thompson Klein, Grossenbacher-Mansuy, & Häberli, 2001, p. 7): _[T]ransdisciplinarity is a new form of learning and problem-solving involving cooperation among different parts of society and academia in order to meet the complex challenges of society [...]. A practice-oriented approach, transdisciplinarity is not confined to a closed circle of scientific experts, professional journals and academic departments where knowledge is produced [...]. Through mutual learning, the knowledge of all participants is enhanced, including local knowledge, scientific knowledge and the knowledgesof concerned industries, businesses, and non-governmental organizations_." [4]

### Transdisciplinarity as "Mode 2" knowledge production
>"Following Klein’s description, Halina Dunin-Woyseth and Fredrik Nilsson (Chapter 6) relate transdisciplinarity to a “Mode 2” of knowledge production. They recognise in particular the relevance of “Mode 2” research, or transdisciplinarity, for design scholars as a new “in-practice model” of research, which has great similarities to design and thus allows for design professions to contribute to knowledge production from within their own intellectual identity." [4]

Att "Mode 2" påvisar likheten med design och därmed bereder väg för designers att bidra till "Mode 2" kunskapsproduktion
