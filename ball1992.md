The concept of 'structures of housing provision' (SHP) as a means to acknowledge that "there are combinations of social agents involved in housing provision that relate to each other in emprically observable ways" [@ball1992, p. 3]. Här beskrivs SHP som "a combined physical and social process which is continous and usually changes over time" [@ball1992, p. 3] och att "understanding the relation of those social agents to each other and to the physical aspect of provision is important when investigating many issues associated with housing" [@ball1992, p. 3]. De skriver vidare att housing tjänar en ekonomisk och social roll [@ball1992, p. 4] 

SHP vilar också på "the empirical assertion that the inter-relation between production, exchange and consumption and the social agents involved are important for most housing-related issues, and that the prime inter-relations can relatively easily be identified to enable their specification" [@ball1992, p. 4] och här förklaras att den här typen av empirical assertion inte är något konstigt utan att det är få sociala teorier som skulle klarat sig utan dem. Ett exempel som nämns är Adam Smiths 'osynliga hand'.

Men huruvida en 'assertion' är valid beror på dess "accuracy and/or usefulness" [@ball1992, p. 4]. Det är intressant för det kopplar till att pragmatiska sättet är just med fokus på användning.

Så vad hävdar de att dessa SHP tjänar för roll? Jo, att de "accurately summarise the main forms of housing provision in countries at particular poins in time" [@ball1992, p. 4] samt att den "is meant to provide a productive framework within which housing-related issues can be examined. It enables empirical material to be ordered and interrelated in a particular way and by doing so
closes off certain lines of explanation." [@ball1992, p. 4]

Och de skriver vidare att "The idea of SHP is to draw together for housing provision what are often called the spheres of consumption, exchange and production and to argue that none of them should be seen in isolation." [@ball1992, p. 6]

De argumenterar att provision ofta likställs med produktion men att de i praktiken inte är så utan att även t.ex. konsumption spelar en viktig roll:

> The provision/production distinction is extremely significant. Housing provision means to make housing available for consumption in the same way as building up a stock of food in a larder. This is not to say that consumption lies outside of the provision process - with provision a means to an end called consumption. Housing provision should not be seen as such a static linear process. Instead it is a dynamic one in which the nature of current consumption affects future consumption possibilities and with them the exchange and production aspects of provision as well. This point is particularly significant with housing as it is a durable good that lasts for years, so that consumption can be a continuous process. Living in a dwelling is helping to sustain the possibility of it being inhabited in the future. Future consumption possibilities with existing housing are affected by the role of consumption within a SHP - such as rights of ownership and use, the time profile of costs and benefits, potential financial gains and who benefits. So production is only one element within a SHP. Many people explicitly or implicitly recognise the significance of production, such as when saying that housing is too expensive for most people because the statement recognises housing's high cost of production. Its precise role however is an empirical question that depends on the research questions being asked. [@ball1992, p. 7]

De menar också att det inte är så lätt att genom policies styra eller kontrollera bostadsförsörjningen viket de skriver att deen liberala socildemokrtiska traditionen tycks förutsätta:

>The liberal/social democratic tradition, so strong in most of post-war West Europe, assumes that government housing-related policies can directly respond to people's housing needs and problems. Little explicit attention is paid to constraints deriving from the ways in which housing is actually provided. [@ball1992, p. 8]

>The interactions between policy changes and existing SHP are frequently more complex than many policy analysts are prepared to recognise. For example, government attempts to subsidise people's housing costs soon become embroiled in problems such as higher rents and housing and land prices. [@ball1992, p. 8]

>it is contingent and transient because of the everchanging context in which it exists. Approaches to housing analysis which are strongly policycentre may find it difficult to explain such shifts... [@ball1992, p. 8] 

Med andra ord behöver just kontexten tas i beaktande och policies kan inte friställas från den.
