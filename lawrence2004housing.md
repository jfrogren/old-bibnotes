# Notes on Lawrence, R. J. (2004): Housing and health: from interdisciplinary principles to transdisciplinary research and practice

Mitt intryck av artikeln är att den har en väldigt allmänbildande karaktär kring själva områden. Kritiken är möjligtvis att här framställs denna approach som så frånvarande i den akademiska världen, men hur väl stämmer det överens med verkligheten? Finns inte medvetenheten utan att det främst är det att organisationsstrukturerna sätter käppar i hjulet?

## Disciplinarity
>"In this article, disciplinarity refers to the specialisation of academic disciplines
>that became strong during the 19th century [4]. [p. 488]"

[4] J. Klein, Crossing Boundaries: Knowledge, Disciplinarities, and Interdisciplinarities, University Press of Virginia, Charlottesville, 1996.

## Multidisciplinary
>"Multidisciplinary refers to research in which each specialist remains within her/his discipline and contributes using disciplinary concepts and methods." [p. 488]

## Interdisciplinary
>"Interdisciplinary contributions can be interpreted as the bringing together of disciplines which retain their own concepts and methods that are applied to a mutually agreed subject. In these studies one contributor will usually co-ordinate the research process and seek integration. Interdisciplinarity can be considered as the mixing together of disciplines, whereas..." [p. 488]
    
## Transdisciplinarity
>"transdisciplinarity implies a fusion of disciplinary knowledge with the know-how of
>lay-people that creates a new hybrid which is diﬀerent from any speciﬁc constituent
>part [5]. This interpretation means that transdiciplinarity is not an automated pro-
>cess that stems from the bringing together of people from diﬀerent disciplines or
>professions. In addition, it requires an ingredient that some have called ‘‘transcendence’’. 
>This implies the giving up of sovereignty over knowledge, the generation of
>new insight and knowledge by collaboration, and the capacity to consider the
>know-how of professionals and lay-people. Collectively, transdiciplinary contributions 
>enable the cross-fertilisation of ideas and knowledge from diﬀerent contributors 
>that leads to an enlarged vision of a subject, as well as new explanatory
>theories [6]. Transdisciplinarity is a way of achieving innovative goals, enriched
>understanding and a synergy of new methods. All these are essential if our current
>understanding of the interrelations between health and residential environments is
>to be improved." [p. 489]

>"Transdisciplinary research and practice require a common conceptual framework
>and analytical methods based on shared terminology, mental images and common
>goals. Once these have been formulated, then the next requirement is to develop a
>research agenda based conceptually and pragmatically on diverse sources of data
>and information that can be organised in ways to help understand, interpret and
>deal with problems [8]." [p. 489]

## Multidisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity are complementary
>"Multidisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity are complementary
>rather than being mutually exclusive. It is important to stress this complementarity
>because without specialised disciplinary studies there would be no in-depth knowledge 
>and data [7]." [489]

Just detta att "without specialised disciplinary studies there would be no in-depth knowledge 
and data" är viktigt att komma ihåg. Och den källan kan vara viktig att läsa. Det är denna:

## Health - where the word derives from
>"The word health is derived from the old English word ‘‘hal’’ meaning whole,
>healed and sound." [490]

## Health - as defined by Roderick Lawrence
>"Health is deﬁned in this article as a condition or state of human beings resulting from the interrelations between humans and their biological, chemical, physical and social environment. All these components of residential environments should be compatible with their basic needs and their full functional activity including biological reproduction over a long period. Health is the result of both the direct pathological eﬀects of chemicals, some biological agents and radiation, and the inﬂuence of physical, psychological and social dimensions of daily life including housing, transport and other characteristics of metropolitan areas." [490]

## Environment - historical definitions
>"Environment derives from the word ‘‘environnement’’ ﬁrst used in the French
>language about the year 1300 by Godefroy. Initially it was used in the sense of a
>deﬁning contour or the external boundary of an object. Then, during the 16th century, 
>Estienne redeﬁned the term to mean the group of natural and artiﬁcial things
>that condition human life (and notably not all living organisms). This deﬁnition is
>similar to that in a contemporary Oxford English Dictionary except that it includes
>all organisms: ‘‘the conditions under which any person or thing lives or is
>developed; the sum total of inﬂuences which modify and determine the development 
>of life and character’’. Today the term human environment not only refers to
>those characteristics which people have constructed, modiﬁed or perceived as components 
>of human settlements but also interpersonal relations and social organisation 
>which eﬀect both physical and mental health and psychological well being." [491]

## The aim of housing

>"Housing is meant to address basic human needs for shelter and security by providing 
>protection against climatic conditions (excessive heat and cold) and
>unwanted intrusions from insects, rodents and environmental nuisances such as
>noise that may be harmful for health and well being. Housing contains household
>activities and possessions." [491]

## Housing as a noun and a verb

>"Turner made the important distinction between housing
>as a noun and housing as a verb [12]. According to Turner, housing can be considered 
>as a product (from an individual housing unit to the housing stock in a neighbourhood 
>or city). He also suggested that housing can be considered as a //
>process by referring to the provision and maintenance of all kinds of residential
>buildings either by public authorities or private initiatives. " [491-492]

New York, 1976.

## Housing environment viewed as capacity to nurture and sustain social and psychological processes
>"The housing environment can be considered in terms of its capacity to nurture
>and sustain social and psychological processes as Halpern has argued [13]." [492]

[13] D. Halpern, Mental Health and the Built Environment: More than Bricks and Mortar, Taylor and
Francis, London, 1995.

## The residential context of health
>"Hartig and Lawrence have used the term ‘‘the residential context of health’’ to refer to all these dimensions that deﬁne the interrelated nature of housing and health [17]." [493]

[17] T. Hartig, R. Lawrence (Eds.), The residential context of health, Journal of Social Issues (special issue) 59 (2) 2003.

## Citizen participation as a means to define and promote health
>"In the late 1970s citizen participation was considered for the ﬁrst
> time in relation to primary health care in the Declaration of Primary Health Care
> at Alma Ata in 1977. Since then, participation has become an established component 
>of deﬁnitions of health and as a means of promoting health in communities." [494]

## The history of participatory approaches in decision making about housing, urban planning, etc.
>"Participatory approaches for decision making about housing, urban planning,
>environmental conservation policies and public health have been increasingly advocated 
>by international conferences and organisations since the Earth Summit in
>Rio de Janeiro in 1992. This trend was endorsed by Agenda 21, which advocates
>citizen participation in decision-making. In 1993, the Eight-Action Programme on
>the Environment was launched by the European Commission. It includes a strong //
>commitment to public participation, which is considered to be the condition sine
>qua non for achieving sustainable development (see Bruce et al. this issue)." [494-495]

## No consensus about the definition and methods of participatory processes
>"There is no consensus about the deﬁnition and methods of participatory processes. 
>Participation can be interpreted as a broad term that refers to dialogue
>between policy institutions and civic society in order to formulate goals, projects
>and the allocation of resources in order to achieve desired outcomes [28]. A wide
>range of techniques and methods can be used including civic forums, focus groups,
>citizen’s juries, surveys, role playing and gaming. These techniques can be applied
>using aids or tools such as maps, plans, photographs, small- or large-scale simulation 
>models and computed aided design kits [29]." [495]

## Complex issues should not be interpreted in democratic societies by one set of criteria or values
>"The main contribution of participatory approaches is that they facilitate the formulation 
>and evaluation of a range of options from diﬀerent viewpoints. These
>approaches have been applied at the local level by municipal governments and
>non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on the understanding that complex issues
>should not be interpreted in democratic societies by one set of criteria or values.
>Participatory approaches complement expert knowledge and advice by including
>the life experience of citizens and social norms. They are one way that enables professionals 
>and politicians to establish’’ a new social contract with society’’ [30]." [495]

## Academics, professionals and politicians have created conceptual and institutional barriers
>"In order to promote more eﬀective links between scientists and professional
>practitioners it is necessary to build bridges between researchers in diﬀerent disciplines,
>and then between them, decision-makers and lay-people. At the outset it is
>noteworthy that there appears to be no methodological reasons for this lack of collaboration. Nonetheless, academics, professionals and politicians have created conceptual and institutional barriers that hinder eﬀective partnerships. Some of these barriers will now be brieﬂy summarised:

>1. Conceptual barriers such as inapt analogies, metaphors and models used by academics
>and professionals who do not address the complexity of the human-made environment but
>promote rational, utilitarian approaches to interpret the layout, use and management of
>residential environments.

>2. Institutional barriers stemming from the professionalisation, the segmentation
>and the bureaucratisation of expertise and knowledge, by which ‘‘experts’’ apply
>technocratic knowledge in order to apply instrumental rationalism based largely
>on quantitative proposals at the expense of qualitative dimensions including the
>tacit know-how of lay-people.

>3. Social barriers produced by social diﬀerentiation and compounded by shortcomings
>in formal education and a lack of information transfer between professionals,
>politicians and the public. The consequent lack of communication between interest groups
>means that democratic practices such as the involvement of citizens in the design and
>management of residential environments are not common and, consequently, lay-people are
>frequently unaware of policy decision-making about their city and their local neighbourhood.

>This article argues that conceptual barriers take precedence over the others, such
>that institutional and social barriers reﬂect and reinforce conceptual ones." [496]

## An integrated approach to health and human settlement is needed in academic research
>"an analysis of the interrelations between multiple components of any human ecosystem is necessary. Systemic interpretations of human illness, health and local environments have a long but chequered history. They can be traced back as least as far as the Hippocratic treatise ''On Airs, Waters, and Places’’ published initially about 2600 years ago [32]. Hippocrates applied an integrated approach that is far removed from much contemporary academic research and professional practice adopted by people who isolate factors from each other and from the contextual conditions in which they occur." [497]

Att hälsa och miljö hänger samman har funnits med länge i mänskligt tänkande åtminstone sen Hippokrates, men i den akademiska världen isoleras i stor utsträckning dessa världar från varandra, menar Lawrence.

## Ecology - history and meaning of the term
>"The term ‘‘ecology’’ derives from the ancient Greek words ‘‘oikos’’ and ‘‘logos’’and means ‘‘science of the habitat’’. It is generally agreed that this term was used ﬁrst by Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919), a German zoologist, in 1866. The word ecology designates a science that deals with the interrelationships between organisms and their surroundings. Since the late 19th century the term ‘‘ecology’’ has been interpreted in numerous ways. For example, in the natural sciences, botanists and zoologists use the term ‘‘general ecology’’ to refer to the interrelations between animals, plants and their immediate surroundings." [497]

## Human ecology - definition
>"Human ecology explicitly deals with people-environment relations [33]. It provides a conceptual framework for academics and practitioners from both the natural sciences (e.g. biology, chemistry and geology) and the human sciences (e.g. anthropology, epidemiology, sociology and psychology) to accept divergent disciplinary concepts and methods and develop an integrated approach." [497]

[33] R. Lawrence, Human ecology, in: M. Tolba (Ed.)Our Fragile World: Challenges and Opportunities
for Sustainable Development, vol. 1EOLSS Publishers, Oxford, 2000, pp. 675–693.

## The ecological perspective's four main sets of interrelated factors 
>"The ecological perspective considers four main sets of interrelated factors: _the individual_, who has a speciﬁc genetic code with a susceptibility and immunity to illness and disease, as well as lifestyle traits; _the agent or vector_ of illness and disease, // including not only bio-geo-physical components of the environment but also the social and psychological dimensions of human settings; _the physical and social environment_ of the individual which affects the susceptibility of the host, the virulence of bio-physical agents and the exposure, quantity and nature of the contact between host and vector; _the available resources_ used by the individuals and households including housing, nutrition, money, information, and access to health and medical services which ought to be aﬀordable for all groups of the population." [497-498]

Här handlar det alltså om a) _individen_; b) _agenten/vektorn_ som jag tolkar som att sjukdomars förekomst och spridning (just denna faktor är väl den mest svårtolkade); c) _fysiska och sociala miljön_; d) _tillgängliga resurser_.
