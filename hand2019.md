# Notes on Hand et al. (2019) - Initiating participatory action research with older adults: lessons learned through reflexivity

#### Syfte

> In this article, we describe the initiation of a PAR project with older adults and reflect on the alignment of this process with key participatory principles and fit within typical research structures.

Artikeln skildrar en form av participatorisk forskning som de är tveksamt om vi bedriver. Här utgås från en viss grupp som kan liknas vid en community och den forskning som bedrivs med dem är mer aktivistisk såsom jag tolkar beskrivningen. Artikelförfattarna använder sig hela tiden av begreppet PAR och de referenser de använder använder begreppet CBPR. HÄr är t.ex. ett utdrag ur artikeln:

> Khanlou and Peter (2005) point out that researcher and participant roles are blurred in PAR, making it unclear how informed consent should be obtained, and suggest that the initiator of the research should engage community members in dialogue that could itself constitute informed consent (Khanlou & Peter, 2005).

Det är inte riktigt den typen av forskning vi bedriver skulle jag starkt hävda. 

#### Slutsatser

> Findings point to the tensions between developing relationships over time and time-sensitive calls for funding, how traditional conceptions of research can influence creating equitable partnerships, and the need for development of ethical and publishing guidelines that address participatory approaches. These key insights can be applied to help achieve the potential of PAR: to address issues of concern by collaboratively and equitably working with the people most affected.

Här är slutsatserna som dras i lite mer detalj:

> First, initiating PAR with communities and developing relationships over time is in tension with funding calls that researchers and practitioners respond to. The initial stage of this project has highlighted that it is possible to engage in PAR that starts with a researcher-led idea. There is a need to build flexibility into initial project objectives and design to enable the project to evolve and new questions to form beyond the bounded project. Equitable partnerships in this instance may take longer and require greater intentionality to establish. 

> Second, attending to issues of trust amongst collaborators and opening a space to develop trusting relationships is needed to form collaborative relationships. The nature of relationships and levels of trust/mistrust may be revealed over time; mistrust needs to be taken into consideration and, if possible, addressed, in order for a PAR project to progress. 

> Third, implementation of PAR principles can operate on a continuum, rather than a dichotomy, in which principles are implemented to the greatest extent possible. This process requires ongoing reflexivity regarding what is happening and how principles can be better integrated into a given project. Next, creating equitable partnerships can be hindered by assumptions held by co-researchers // about their potential role in research, understandings that are likely influenced by larger social conceptions of traditional research. We found that a balance between information sharing and simply “jumping in” to a project, with reflexivity, was an effective approach that enabled all involved to learn through direct experience.

> Finally, PAR principles of equitable partnerships and empowerment are balanced against REB interpretations of participants as being vulnerable and needing protection. When applying PAR approaches, an ongoing dialogue with REBs is necessary, to enable understanding of the approach by all parties and to ensure that research ethics procedures do not work against implementing PAR principles. Further development of ethical and publishing guidelines that address PAR approaches are needed

#### Key principles that Participatory Action Research (PAR) (or rather CBPR) should embody

> Israel et al. (2008) described key principles that PAR [My comment: or rather CBPR] should embody, including:
> "1. Collaborative, equitable partnership in all phases of the research project
> 2. An empowering process
> 3. Co-learning among all partners
> 4. Capacity building and systems change
> 5. A balance of research and action
> 6. Long-term involvement with a commitment to sustainability." [p. 2]

#### More attention to issues of power relations needed within participatory research particularly related to projects involving older adults

> ...more attention to issues of reflexivity, positionality, and power relations is needed within participatory research (Sultana, 2007), particularly related to projects involving older adults. [p. 2]

#### Initial step of PAR is forming a partnership with a community

> According to Duran and colleagues (2013), the initial step of PAR is forming a partnership with a community, defined as a group of people with a shared identity such as geographical location or culture.[p. 3jj]
