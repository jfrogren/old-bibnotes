# Notes on Pratt, B. (2019) - Engagement as co-constructing knowledge: a moral necessity in public health research

#### Sammanfattning av vad denna artikel argumenterar för

> This article makes the normative argument that... [co‐construction of knowledge]... is necessary to achieve the foundational moral aims of public health research — building relations of equality and addressing the health needs of those considered disadvantaged — which reflect the field's underlying commitment to social justice. [p. 805]

> It will argue that co‐constructing knowledge is necessary to achieve the moral aims of public health research. (Whether co‐constructing knowledge advances the moral aims of other types of health research is beyond the scope of the article.)

Viktigt att poängtera att här handlar det alltså om folkhälsa och inte hälsa mer generellt. 

#### A philosophical rationale for why researchers should perform engagement in health research has not been provided before

> A philosophical rationale for why researchers should perform engagement in health research as the co‐construction of knowledge has thus far not been provided by ethics scholars, though some normative work has been done in other disciplines like development studies and community‐based participatory research (CBPR) in support of undertaking it. [ref. 21] [p. 806]

#### The two moral aims of public health research

> Two core moral aims of public health research are: (a) addressing  the health needs of those who are considered disadvantaged and (b) building relations of equality by supporting self‐determination. These aims are identified by both theories of social justice and feminist ethics. [ref. 28]

#### Young's account of social justice

> Young's account of social justice [...] calls for furthering two key values: participating in determining one's or society's actions (self‐determination) and developing and exercising one's capacities (self‐development). [ref. 34] Denial of the former constitutes domination, while denial of the latter constitutes oppression. [ref. 35] [p. 808]

[35] Young, I. M. (1990). Justice and the politics of difference. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.

#### What self-determination means

> Self‐determination means that all those who are significantly affected by a problem and its solution are included in discussions and decision‐making about it. [ref. 40] ‘Significantly affected’ refers to those whose options for action would be substantially conditioned by the decision—namely, those whose basic interests would be affected by the decision. [ref. 41] [p. 808]


#### Three ways in which co‐constructing knowledge advances the two moral aims of public health research

> It next identifies and discusses three ways in which co‐constructing knowledge advances those moral aims: by facilitating self‐determination, supporting individuals’ right to research, and maximizing social knowledge to address cognitive and epistemic injustice. Objections to the arguments presented in the article are then articulated and defended against. [p. 805]


##### How co-constructing knowledge facilitates self-determination

> Whether and how members of society can meet their health needs is impacted by what preventative interventions are available and affordable to them. Co‐constructing knowledge in public health research thus enables members of society to participate in decisions that affect their basic interests. They can assert control over the research projects that affect them. [ref. 44] Within a society, those signifi‐ // cantly affected by public health research would include people living in the research setting or people who are part of the groups and populations of focus in such projects. [p. 808-809] 

##### How co-constructing knowledge supports the right to research

> [Arjun Appadurai] argues that research should be recognized as a right of a special kind owed to all members of society — namely, the triple capacity to inquire, to analyze, and to communicate. [ref. 51] It is the capacity to make disciplined, systematic inquiries into those things we need to know about our own lives and worlds in order to gain strategic knowledge. [p. 809]

> The co‐construction of public health knowledge supports research users and beneficiaries’ realization of their right to research [...] Being involved in decision‐making over each stage of the public health research process would build their ability to formulate research questions, collect and analyze data,and disseminate research findings. [p. 809]

##### How co-constructing knowledge maximizes social knowledge

> Even where problems of global social injustice are recognized, existing approaches formulated and developed by Western modernity are not solving them. [ref. 69] Modes, models, means, and ends of social transformation are potentially much vaster than those identified by modern science. Ways of knowing beyond Western modernity can identify other forms of knowledge that point to additional ways of intervening. [ref. 70] Maximizing the social knowledge base used to de velop interventions by pooling the knowledge of all social positions will construct a more comprehensive account of how social processes work and the likely consequences of proposed interventions. Here, the situated knowledge of those marginalized by social institu tions and norms is identified as an especially vital resource. [ref. 71] It is thus imperative to capture the immense existing variety of knowledges and practices to maximize our transformative potential. Without cognitive and epistemic justice, larger struggles for social justice will not be realized. [ref. 72] [p. 810]

> Co‐constructing knowledge comprises a way of drawing out epistemologies of the South and maximizing the social knowledge base. It can help address global social injustice by making sense of aspects of marginalized social groups’ social experiences that are obscured from understanding and identifying new ways of intervening to address complex problems based on multiple ways of knowing. As such, this form of engagement is well‐suited to the field of public health research. [p. 810]

##### How informing does not maximize social knowledge

> In contrast, informing does not comprise a way of drawing out epistemologies of the South or the situated knowledge of the disadvantaged. [p. 811]

##### How consulting is not maximizing social knowledge

> Consultations have been shown to enrich the knowledge researchers use to identify the problems facing communities. [ref. 81] However, unlike co‐constructing knowledge, the capacity of consultations to support intercultural translation is questionable. The development of new constellations of public health knowledge will rest solely with researchers using information derived from those considered disadvantaged. Any new knowledge will be constructed by researchers rather than being a joint product of dialogue and translation. This may limit such knowledge's transformative potential. It also means that only researchers’ understanding of the problem will be broadened rather than both parties’ understanding being enriched. [p. 811]

#### Possible objections

##### Social justice is not a foundational value of public health 

> If social justice is not a foundational (or at least an important) value for public health research, then adopting a form of engagement that furthers such a value is not essential to the field. In response, it is important to note that social justice has been identified as a foundational value in numerous public health ethics frameworks. [ref. 82] There seems to be strong convergence amongst ethics scholars and public health practitioners that advancing social justice is a core goal of the field of public health. [p. 811]

Hon säger att om nu inte social justice är ett grundläggande värde i folkälsoforskning så har forskning genom  co-creation of knowledge...

> can advance other ethical values underlying public health: procedural justice, population level utility (advancing community well‐being), solidarity, and community trust. [p. 811]


##### Other forms of engagement can advance other moral values of public health research equally or more effectively than the co-construction of knowledge

> This is potentially  true and requires further exploration that is beyond the scope of this work. The article is not disputing the value of other forms of engagement or saying that co‐constructing knowledge is the only form of engagement that should be performed in public health research. Instead, it is hoped that the arguments presented show readers why such a form of engagement is necessary in the field of public health research to advance its moral aims relating to social justice. [p. 812]

##### Undertaking engagement as the co‐construction of knowledge creates significant burdens on research users and beneficiaries that are disproportionate to the benefits they will accrue.

Här skriver hon att detta må vara fallet men att det finns sätt att involvera dessa disadvantaged i denna typ av forskning som säkerställer att deras basala behov uppfylls, t.ex. genom att tilldela dem en lön eller ersättning för deras deltagande. Om detta inte går att uppbåda utan bördan är större än den förmodade belöningen så kan det vara oetiskt att bedriva denna typ av forskning och då får man försöka hitta andra individer/grupper att forska tillsammans med.

#### Any substantial increase in public health research being performed as the co‐construction of knowledge will require significant changes to the research environment

Som svar på det skriver hon:

> While appreciating that making structural changes to the funding and education sectors will be a challenging and politically fraught process, effecting such shifts seems necessary to get closer to solving the complex problems with which public health grapples. [p. 812]






#### Three forms of engagement used in research projects enligt författaren

Artikelförfattaren listar tre sorters engagemang i forskningsprojekt:

- Informing
- Consulting
- Co-construction of knowledge

#### Vad 'co-construction of knowledge' betyder i sammanhanget

Artikelförfattaren skriver att co-construction of knowledge betyder att:

> ...researchers jointly construct knowledge with research users and beneficiaries; all parties design and conduct research together in ways that achieve the porposes of both sets of actors. It entails shared decision-making in all phases of research projects. Co-constructing knowledge is also a process of bringing together multiple kinds of knowledge and multiple perspectives to construct an understanding of research phenomena based on a plurality of situated knowledges. This includes knowledge and perspectives of those outside the research sector: research users and beneficiaries, be they members of communities, businesses, governments, or activist organisations.[p. 806]

#### Vad 'consulting' betyder i sammanhanget

> [Consulting] is characterizd by research users and beneiciaries being invited to give their input (feedback, suggestions, and critiques) on aspects of research projects but with no assurance that it will be used by those who decide. [...] Often, their consultation occurs through specifically established advisory groups. [p. 806]

#### Vad 'informing' betyder i sammanhanget 

> Informing means raising awareness and understanding of what research is and of already defined research projects within host communities or populations. Research users and beneficiaries are told of the outputs of decision-making in research projects but do not inform the process or decisions in any way. [p. 806]


#### Sharp and Foster's spectrum of power sharing in health research

Artikelförfattaren refererar till Sharp och Fosters spectrum of power sharing in health research:

> Sharp and Foster describe a spectrum of power sharing in health research, from community dialogue through community consultation and approval to full partnership, where the latter implies the greatest community empowerment. [ref. 5] [p. 805]

#### Tindana et al.'s 'community consultation' vs. 'collaborative partnership'

Artikelförfattaren refererar till Tindana et al.'s 'community consultation' vs. 'collaborative partnership':

> Tindana et al. distinguish between 'community consultation' and 'collaborative partnership', which means involving local stakeholders in assessing local health problems; planning, conducting // and overseeing research; and integrating research into the health care system. [ref. 7] [p. 805-806]
