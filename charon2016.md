# Notes on Charon, R., Hermann, N., & Devlin, M. J. (2016) - Lose reading and creative writing in clinical education: teaching attention, representation, and affiliation


Vid College of Physicians and Surgeons på Columbia University har de börjat undervisa i close reading and creative writing. Detta ligger till grund för ämnet *Narrative medicine* och bottnar i övertygelsen om att:

> students grow as clinicians as they strengthen their powers of representation.

Det finns också en hel del stöd i forskningen för detta som de listar i artikeln.

Så här skriver de om målet med arbetet:

> The goal of this work, ultimately, is for learners to achieve a state of attentive and empathic affiliation with a patient, born of their efforts to represent what they perceive, to seek the necessary perspectives beyond their own, to register that which is mysterious or unclear, to wonder about the mysterious, to ask questions about the unclear, to generate hypotheses about the patient’s situation, and to test those hypotheses in the growing affiliation with the patient.

Till hjälp för close reading har de skapat en *Reading Guide*:

> The Reading Guide reminds our readers to search for aspects of a written text—like sensory detail, perspective, genre, time, voice, metaphor, and plot—that may harbor meaning for both writer and reader. Many of the physicians who have used the Reading Guide over several years at Columbia and elsewhere have told us that they found it helpful in developing habits of close reading.

Vad de erbjuder studenterna:

> Our students, when asked to write creatively, are offered an otherwise rare opportunity to recognize aspects of their consciousness that typically lie outside of their awareness. Because we have written ourselves, have subjected our own writing to close reading by others, and have insisted that our faculty–learners do so too, we all have experienced the realization that close reading routinely reveals things to the writer that were unperceived before the reading. This is the power of writing.

Sammanfattningsvis:

> We have embarked on an institution-wide effort to teach close reading and creative writing at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, informed in part by aesthetic theories of creativity, so as to equip students and faculty with the prerequisites to provide attentive, empathic clinical care. The Reading Guide is one pedagogic tool that has helped our faculty to develop the skills needed for close reading and responding to their students’ writing. This work has taught us that (1) faculty members themselves must develop skills in reading and writing and have readers for what they write, (2) a writer is needed to guide this process, and (3) a change in institutional culture is needed to permit and encourage creative work among students and faculty. That our institution has come to value and endorse the teaching and exercise of creativity as a critical aspect of its clinical enterprise is both the strength of the work described here and a limitation to its generalizability.
