### Notes on Archibald et al. (2018) - Transdisciplinary research for impact: protocol for a realist evaluation of the relationship between transdisciplinary research collaboration and knowledge translation

    OBS! Detta är endast ett studieprotokoll, ej en fullständig vetenskaplig artikel.

#### Bakgrund

> ...little empirical evidence exists on whether (and how) transdisciplinary collaboration influences research outcomes, including those typically associated with translation, such as research productivity (eg, number of publications). [ref.1]

> Given the growing emphasis on transdisciplinary paradigms, research is needed to develop stronger theoretical explanations of if, how, why, for whom and under what circumstances transdisciplinary collaboration influences knowledge translation.

Det är alltså det som studien avser göra.


#### Syfte

Syftet med studien är...

>The aims of this study are to understand: (i) various perspectives of knowledge translation within a transdisciplinary research team and (ii) if, how, for whom and under what circumstances a transdisciplinary research approach and associated knowledge sharing activities can contribute to a shared understanding of knowledge translation.

#### RQs

Our research questions are as follows:
1. Does transdisciplinary collaboration impact knowl-
edge translation and if so, by which mechanisms is
this achieved?
2. What contextual factors determine whether the
identified mechanisms produce their intended out-
comes?
3. In what circumstances (ie, combination(s) of context
factors and mechanisms) are transdisciplinary teams
most likely to be effective in terms of impacting knowl-
edge translation?

#### Hur definieras 'Knowledge translation'(KT)?

> ...knowledge translation (ie, the interactive and iterative process of knowledge creation, sharing and use for better health outcomes, and involving multiple system stakeholders) [ref. 6]

Med KT åsyftas här alltså inte bara själva överförandet utan även genererandet av kunskap. Det var för mig något nytt att definitionen var så vid.

#### Olikheter i konceptualiseringen av KT kan utgöra barriärer för hur den lyckas

> How diverse team members understand and enact the concept and process of knowledge translation (ie, the interactive and iterative process of knowledge creation, sharing and use for better health outcomes, and involving multiple system stakeholders) [ref. 6] can produce barriers to knowledge creation and knowledge sharing activities conducted within the team. Such barriers may have subsequent downstream effects on the uptake and impact of the knowledge produced.

Bra att de tar upp det. 


#### Barriers to intraorganisational knowledge translation

> Barriers to intraorganisational knowledge translation have been studied outside of the health context. For example, Carlile, [ref. 7] in an ethnographic study of product development, identified three types of boundaries, described as *syntactic* (eg, language and terminology), *semantic* (eg, interpretation of knowledge) and *pragmatic* (eg, the nature of knowledge; organisational politics and culture; roles and responsibilities). Similar boundaries— each with different levels of complexity—are likely to exist in collaborative academic environments. [ref. 5] Understanding more about such boundaries and resultant barriers to internal knowledge translation activities can inform planning and facilitate collaboration across disciplines.

För att sammanfatta så verkar denna studie lovande, men detta är bara protokollet så än så länge finns inget resultat.
