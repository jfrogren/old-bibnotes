# Notes on Dudley et al. (2015) - What difference does patient and public involvement make and what are its pathways to impact? qualitative study of patients and researchers from a cohort of randomised clinical trials

#### Resultatet

> None of our informants identified PPI as having an unfavourable impact on the trial. Of the 21 CIs [chief investigators] interviewed, 14 described PPI as having an impact and seven explicitly stated that they felt PPI had not made an impact

> According to informants, the opportunity for PPI to make a difference was influenced by two main factors: whether chief investigators had goals and plans for PPI and the quality of the relationship between the research team and the PPI contributors. Early involvement of PPI contributors and including them in responsive (e.g. advisory groups) and managerial (e.g. trial management groups) roles were more likely to achieve impact compared to late involvement and oversight roles (e.g. trial steering committees).

#### Slutsatser

> Those seeking to enhance PPI in trials should develop goals for PPI at an early stage that fits the needs of the trial, plan PPI implementation in accordance with these goals, invest in developing good relationships between PPI contributors and researchers, and favour responsive and managerial roles for contributors in preference to oversight-only roles. These features could be used by research funders in judging PPI in trial grant applications and to inform policies to optimise PPI within trials.

##### PPI in research justified in two main ways

> PPI in research has been justified in two main ways: normatively on moral, ethical or political grounds consistent with slogans like “nothing about us without us”[10,11], and substantively in terms of the PPI potential to benefit research [10].

Det stämmer ju överens med hur mina tankegånga går, dvs at det handlar om etiska och epistemiologiska skäl. Desa referenser kan därför vara användbara:

Kanske inte de bästa referenserna dessvärre.

##### Indications that PPI can have favourable impacts

> There are indications that PPI can have favourable impacts upon every stage of the research process [13,15–19] by helping to ensure that research funds are appropriately prioritised, that research evidence is relevant to patients, and by improving recruitment and retention rates and supporting the uptake of research in practice.
