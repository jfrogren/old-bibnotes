# Notes on Backhouse et al. (2016) - Older care-home residents as collaborators or advisors in research: a systematic review

#### Syfte

> to conduct a systematic review to find out to what extent and how older care-home residents have been involved in research as collaborators or advisors. 

#### Övergripande slutsatser

> small-scale studies involved residents as collaborators in participatory action research, whereas larger studies involved residents as consultants in advisory roles. There are multiple facilitators of and barriers to involving residents as PPI members. The reporting of PPI varies. While it is difficult to evaluate the impact of involving care-home residents on the research outcomes, impact has been demonstrated from more inclusive research processes with care-home residents. The review shows that older care-home residents can be successfully involved in the research process.

#### Facilitators of and barriers to involving residents as PPI members

Dessa kunde tematiskt grupperas under följande kategorier:

> social factors, skills, resources, care-home organisational factors and the organisation of the research. [p. 341]

##### Social factors

> The development of good relationships with residents aided involvement. Trust and transparency were important [11, 23]; residents’ trust in researcher conﬁdentiality could impact on their willingness to be involved [34, 23, 25]. Valuing residents’ involvement [32] and creating a safe space for them to voice ideas could enhance their involvement [35]. Residents’ confidence levels [34] and whether they had a low or agitated mood [29] also affected their participation, while some residents and staff could be reluctant to engage with new ideas [23]. [p. 341]

##### Skills

> Resident and researcher skills could impact on resident involvement. Cognitive impairment sometimes presented a barrier, since it meant some residents had poor knowledge and negotiating skills [23] or were prevented from taking an active role in meetings [24]. Sensory impairments such as hearing difficulties and poor vision could hinder participation [25]. To accommodate the changing health of some residents, Killett et al. [29] held their final meetings with residents in care homes rather than at external venues. Researchers’ communication and interpersonal skills were essential. Investigators had to take on the role of a facilitator or mediator in meetings or negotiations [34], foster good relationships with a variety of individuals [25, 35] and offer continued encouragement and support to residents [32]. [p. 341]

##### Resources

> Time and money were cited as barriers. In one study, a lack of funds meant that not all residents interested in contributing to the research could be involved [32]. Action research required financial resources to allow the implementation of the changes identiﬁed [35]. Spending time gaining residents’ conﬁdence and getting to know them were essential to increasing participation but, due to ﬁnancial constraints, were difﬁcult to sustain [24, 34]. One study did not provide feedback to PPI members at its conclusion due to time limitations [27]. Two studies offered care-home residents remuneration for their involvement [28, 29]. [p. 341]

##### Care-home organisational factors

> A supportive organisational culture where management and staff valued the residents’ participation in research and were open to change which might enhance involvement and helped the implementation of action research [23]. In contrast, fragmented leadership and the attitudes and abilities of key powerful individuals could work against residents’ involvement [25]. [p. 341]

##### Organisation of the research

> An emergent design was seen to be important to empower residents, since it allowed them to set the agenda and have some ownership over the study [35]. Flexibility, which could similarly encourage residents’ involvement, was shown in using informal conversations or one-to-one discussions [25, 29]; identifying a main contact or source of support for residents [27, 29]; and allowing ad hoc contact with researchers [24]. However, allowing ad hoc contact with researchers could be a challenge for research staff to respond to. [p. 341]


#### Något ordrikare slutsatser

> Few studies have attempted to involve older care-home residents in the research process. Nonetheless, some have managed to do this successfully. Older care-home residents have been involved as PPI members in two ways: as collaborators in small-scale participatory action research and as advisors on large studies. Multiple barriers to and facilitators of involving residents as PPI members were identified and can be grouped under social factors, skills, resources, care-home organisational factors and the organisation of the research. All studies involving residents in research have been predominantly qualitative in design. Future research is needed to test whether care-home residents could be successfully involved in research with a quantitative design and/or as collaborators or peer researchers, particularly in large studies involving several care homes. The reporting of PPI varies. Comprehensive reporting would allow readers to better assess the impact of PPI on the research. While it is difﬁcult at present to evaluate PPI impact in research outcomes, such impact has been demonstrated in more inclusive research processes with care-home residents. [p. 343]
