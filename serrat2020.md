# Notes on Serrat et al. (2020) - Fifty-five years of research into older people’s civic participation: recent trends, future directions

Här pratas det om 'civic participation'. Vad innebär det?

Här påtalas att det finns en systematisk review om "motivations for and barriers to volunteering (Principi, Chiatti, Lamura, & Frerichs, 2012)" kopplat till older adults' civic participation. 

Det finns också en systematisk review kopplat till "benefits of volunteering in terms of physical and mental health (Jenkinson et al., 2013)."

Dock saknas en "scoping review" där kunskap kring detta område gås igenom och samlas. Artikeln har ett tvåfaldigt syfte:

> first, to analyze critically existing knowledge concerning older people’s civic participation, and second, to pinpoint knowledge gaps and propose new directions for research.

#### Vad är 'civic participation'?

> Referring to activities “…outside the own family and circle of close friends” (Ekman & Amnå, 2012, p. 291), civic participation can be described as active citizen participation “… in the life of a community in order to improve conditions for others or to help shape the community’s future” (Adler & Goggin, 2005, p. 241). [e38]

Det är med andra ord inte samma sak som att delta aktivt i forskning utan syftar mer på ett engagemang som de facto förändrar på ett lokalt och direkt sätt. Dock kan det ju finnas paralleller mellan vilka som engagerar sig på detta sätt och folk som vill engagera sig aktivt i forskning. Tycker dock att det fortfarande är något oklart. Att engagera sig i en bostadsrättsförening, är det civic participation till exempel?

#### Civic participation vs. Civic engagement (or involvement or attention)

> First, there is a differentiation between civic engagement (or involvement or attention) and civic participation. Although civic engagement simply denotes psychological attentiveness to social and political issues, participation conveys the idea of action and must be conceived as behavioral in nature.

Alltså är participation inte bara kognitivt utan innefattar ett verkligt handlande.

#### Varför engagerar sig vissa på detta sätt och andra inte?

> Research on antecedents considers why some older people participate in civic activities whereas others do not. Factors associated with civic participation studied thus far include higher human and social capital resources (e.g., McNamara & Gonzales, 2011), personality variables such as higher extraversion (e.g., Mike, Jackson, & Oltmanns, 2014), or simultaneous engagement in other active aging pursuits []

#### Older people’s experiences of participation

> There is growing interest in aspects such as the meanings that participants attach to participation (e.g., Lilburn, Breheny, & Pond, 2018)...

>...or the experiential learning processes that occur within organizations (e.g., Piercy, Cheek, & Teemant, 2011).

#### The effects of civic participation on people who participate.

> civic participation has been associated with better physical and mental health (e.g., Lum & Lightfoot, 2005), higher cognitive function (e.g., Proulx et al., 2018), lower mortality risk (e.g., Okun, Yeung, & Brown, 2013), higher well-being (e.g., Kahana, Bhatta, Lovegreen, Kahana, & Midlarsky, 2013), increased physical activity (e.g., Varma et al., 2016), or decreased loneliness (e.g., Carr et al., 2018).

#### The importance of considering both who participates and where and when civic participation occurs

> When studying this issue among older people, regardless of the stage of the participation process addressed, previous literature highlights the importance of considering both who participates and where and when civic participation occurs. 

> First, older people’s civic participation may be understood from the perspective of diversity. As a group, older people encompass considerable diversity in terms of “… gender, ethnicity, sexuality, disability, health status, need for assistance with personal and domestic care, class, political persuasion, work and life experience” (Barnes, 2005, p. 257). This diversity influences who is able to participate in civic activities, as barriers for participation vary according to older people’s embodied, cultural, and socioeconomic characteristics (Petriwskyj et al., 2017), in which ways they are able to participate, as gender shapes the civic roles expected for older men and women (Nesteruk & Price, 2011), and what benefits accrue from participation, as these vary according to older people’s socioeconomic status (Morrow-Howell, Hong, & Tang, 2009). 

> Second, older people’s civic participation is shaped by the sociopolitical contexts in which participation occurs (Goerres, 2009). Cross-national research (e.g., Haski-Leventhal, 2009) highlights the importance of understanding context when addressing older people’s civic participation.

#### Slutsatser från studien

> research into older people’s civic participation has grown steadily over the past 55 years, and particularly during the last two decades. This reflects a growing interest in academic research in promoting active and successful ways of aging, which echoes policy and practice recommendations by major international organizations (e.g., United Nations, 2002).

##### 1. A need to broaden the scope of research into older people's civic participation

###### Informell civic participation behöver uppvärderas och forskas om mer
> although informal helping behaviors are the most common forms of older people’s civic participation (e.g., Kruse & Schmitt, 2015), our review demonstrates that they have received the least attention in research. This may be due, in part, to the fact that informal helping behaviors could be more difficult to study, as they tend to occur in a more private sphere in comparison to other civic activities, but especially because these behaviors have been barely included within the most prominent models of active and successful aging (e.g., de São José, Timonen, Amado, & Santos, 2017), even if they are of greater importance for older people than other activities commonly included within these models (e.g., Huijg et al., 2017).


###### Older people are not just social actors but also political agents
> research into older people’s civic participation has favored a conception of older people as “contributors” to sustaining welfare states rather than as “political activists” who may challenge the social and political processes underlying welfare states (e.g., Martinson & Minkler, 2006).

> ...we need to move beyond conceiving of older people as social actors and consider them simultaneously as political agents, as a collective whose voices and opinions must be acknowledged in decision-making processes.

#### 2. A need to address contextual aspects of older people's civic participation

> ...contextual aspects of civic participation remain underdeveloped at three levels. [e47]

##### Microcontextual level
> First, at the microcontextual level, we need more research addressing organizational dimensions of participation. An emerging body of studies suggests that organizations play an important role in such aspects as the recruitment and retention of older participants (e.g., Devaney et al., 2015) or the benefits individuals obtain from participation (e.g., Hong & Morrow-Howell, 2013).

##### Mesocontextual level

> The work of Dury, Willems, and colleagues (2016) shows that older people’s perceptions of physical and social dimensions of neighborhood as well as objective municipality features are associated with participation in formal volunteering in later life. However, this mesocontextual dimension remains under-researched, emphasizing the considerable potential to develop new studies concerning neighborhood and community influences on civic participation in later life. [e47]

##### Macrocontextual level

> there is a need for more evidence drawn from countries other than the United States, and especially for cross-cultural research comparing older people’s civic participation across diverse sociopolitical contexts. [e47]

#### 3. A need to explore how participation develops

> older people’s experiences while participating in civic activities are far less addressed than antecedents or outcomes of participation. Such experiences are important in understanding, for example, individuals’ decisions around continuing or withdrawing from participation (e.g., Tang, Morrow-Howell, & Hong, 2009). [e47]

>...more studies should explore older people’s experiences of civic participation, and also the role of these experiences on individuals’ decisions to stop or continue participating. [e47]

> ...most previous studies focus exclusively on later life conditions and experiences to understand civic participation in old age. An exclusive reliance on this approach obscures the causes and consequences of civic participation trajectories over the life-course. Research needs to move on from identifying factors associated with civic participation among older people to examine how these factors unfold over time and influence individuals’ [e47] participation in (or withdrawal from) civic activities across the life-course. [e48]

#### 4. A need to better take into account older people's diversity when studying civic participation

> The small number of papers identified by this scoping review considered only one dimension of diversity, mainly having a disability or health condition, being a woman, or belonging to a racial or ethnic minority. In this respect, recent developments in intersectionality theory emphasize the importance of considering the nonadditive effects of multiple systems of inequality experienced by people with particular social locations. Age by itself represents a system of inequalities, as it has material consequences and influences life chances. Analysis of older people’s civic participation would benefit, therefore, from considering the interaction of age as a system of inequality with suchmother systems as gender, race, class, disability, or sexual orientation.
