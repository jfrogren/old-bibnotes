## In a nutshell (sammanfattande faktaruta hämtad från artikeln)

- Members of the public have been actively participating in scientific research – that is, doing citizen science – for centuries

- The relatively recent professionalization of science has changed the role of citizens in advancing ecological knowledge

- Citizen science has made substantial contributions to our current understanding of ecology and some of the most important historical datasets and museum collections

- Ecologists are increasingly turning to lesser-known datasets collected by citizen scientists to understand long-term changes in the environment and their causes and consequences


## What is citizen science?

> Citizen science refers to the engagement of non-professionals in scientific investigations – asking questions, collecting data, or interpreting results. [285]

> Citizen-science projects generally include a partnership between amateur and professional scientists, although expert amateurs can replace the role of professional scientists. [285]

> Here, we consider “amateur” to mean anyone who is not a professional scientist, and do not intend the term to reflect level of expertise, since some amateurs are in fact leading experts in their fields [285]

> The important characteristic of citizen science is not the level of involvement of either professional scientists or amateurs but rather the public’s participation in genuine scientific research. [285]

## History

> Prior to the professionalization of science in the late 19th century, nearly all scientific research was conducted by amateurs – that is, by people who were not paid as scientists (Vetter 2011a). These individuals were largely pursuing research because of an innate interest in particular topics or questions (Porter 1978). Many amateurs were recognized experts in their field and conducted research // indistinguishable from – and sometimes superior to – that done by most professional scientists of the time. [285-286]

Vilken term skulle jag kunna använda, non-professionals, amateurs? Det låter kanske inte så bra att vare definierat på grundval av något man inte är.

> As early as the 17th century and probably earlier, some of these amateur experts had recruited non-experts to contribute natural history observations. [...] This was a common way for early ecologists, such as John Ray and Carl Linnaeus, to collect specimens and observations from across the known world. Such contributions by non-trained scientists have helped to build some of the most valuable collections of animals, plants, rocks, fossils, artifacts, and other specimens worldwide [286]

> Others who have collected information and data about the natural world in the past include farmers, hunters, and amateur naturalists. For instance, wine-growers in France have been recording grape harvest days for more than 640 years (Chuine et al. 2004), while court diarists in Kyoto, Japan, have been recording dates of the traditional cherry blossom festival for 1200 years (Figure 2; Primack et al. 2009). In China, both citizens and officials have been tracking outbreaks of locusts for at least 3500 years (Tian et al. 2011). [286]

## Professionalization of science

> More recently, during the past 150 years or so, science has become professionalized, while amateurs have often been marginalized. [286]

> Even so, citizen science has continued and even grown in recent years, as it has begun to fill two major niches within current scientific pursuits. The first niche involves projects that tackle ecological questions at scales that would be unachievable through professional science alone. [...] The second major niche that citizen science has filled is in undertaking projects that professional scientists would not do on their own, whether because of the type of question or the place of study. For example, research scientists have incentives to study questions that advance knowledge of the field as a whole and to avoid projects that are too restricted in scope to be widely cited or of interest beyond a narrow audience. Thus, many local, place-based projects go uninvestigated by professional scientists and are sometimes instead carried out by local residents. A project may focus on finding causes of local problems, such as pollution, wildlife deaths, or pest outbreaks, and may also lead to management or policy solutions once the causes are found.

## Progress in citizen science

> Over time, the techniques involved in developing and managing citizen-science projects have changed, improving both the scientific and educational outcomes of many projects. Advances in communications, transportation, and computing have made it easier for volunteers to contribute and for scientists and volunteers to manage and analyze the resulting data. [289]

> Citizen science is also increasingly seen as a way to engage the public in science, improve scientific literacy and interest in science, and inform participants about particular topics, such as butterfly ecology, vernal pool conservation, or climate change (Lowman et al. 2009). This is a major departure from most of the history of citizen science, when projects were set up mainly to achieve scientific objectives. Instead, many are now being organized primarily as a means to improve participants’ scientific literacy and understanding of the topics they are studying (Bonney et al. 2009a). [289]
