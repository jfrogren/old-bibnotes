# Notes on Brown et al. (2018) - Openness, inclusion and transparency in the practice of public involvement in research: a reflective exercise to develop best practice recommendations

Här används 'public involvement' som är det begrepp som jag också kommer att använda i studien. Jag kommer också att hänvisa till INVOLVE även om det är kopplat till en brittisk kontext. Det är ju trots allt så att vi i vår inriktning och i vårt upplägg har inspirerats mycket av Storbritanniens arbete med brukarinvolvering.

Mot bakgrund av det är det teoretiska upplägget i introduktionen väldigt relevant för min studie och jag kan hämta mycket där från teorin. 

#### Syftet

> To critically reflect on the PI practices that underpinned our research project on intimacy and sexuality in care homes, to develop a series of recommendations for improving future PI activities.

#### Resultat

> A number of strengths and limitations of our approach to PI were identified. Clear recommendations for improving PI practice were developed for three broad areas of identified difficulty: (i) communication within and between meetings; (ii) the roles and responsibilities of team members; and (iii) PI resources and productivity.

#### Definition av 'public involvement' hämtad från INVOLVE

> Public involvement in research (PI) is defined as research that is “carried out ‘with’ or ‘by’ members of the public rather than ‘to’, ‘about’ or ‘for’ them.” [1] [p. 442]

#### Vilka utgör vanligtvis 'members of the public' i 'public involvement' och varifrån hämtas de?

> Members of the public involved in research are often drawn from specific target populations, such as patients, service users, or those with a shared experience or demographic characteristic, such as age group. [2] [p. 442]

#### Public involvement increasingly recognized as important element of health and social research

> PI is increasingly recognized as being an important element of health and social research, with advocates outlining its role in supporting values such as empowerment and increased transparency, [2] as well as the benefits arising from the unique knowledge and insights that members of the public can bring to research.

#### Various guidelines exist providing advice to researchers on how to conduct effective PI

> Various guidelines exist that provide advice to researchers on how to conduct effective PI. These include a comprehensive set of briefing notes from the national advisory group on service user involvement “INVOLVE,” as well as a “how-­to” guide for health and biomedical researchers. [4] [p. 442]

#### Chance "corridor" meetings and last-minute decision making typical of academic context could hinder effective communication in Public Involvement (PI) projects 

> a reflective report by academics and patients working together in rheumatology research research [5] revealed specific examples of typical academic working practices that could hinder effective communication in PI projects. These included the chance “corridor” meetings in the workplace from which members of  the public are excluded, as well as the pace and last­minute nature that is typical of academic decision making.

#### Opportunities for less formal discussion between team members can be useful for enabling public members of the team to contribute their thoughts outside of structured meetings

> ...an ethnographic study of three health­focused PI case studies reported how opportunities for less formal discussion between team members (such as phone calls and shared travel time) can be useful for enabling public members of the team to contribute their thoughts outside of structured meetings.

#### Important to provide clear role descriptions in Public Involvement in research

#### Mixed views as to whether members of the public should be given training in the roles they undertake [in public involvement in research]

> ...whilst many researchers have emphasized the importance of providing clear role descriptions in PI, [6-8] there are more mixed views as to whether members of the public should be given training in the roles they undertake. Some consider this to be essential to effective PI, whilst others argue that it is unreasonable to assume that somebody with little or no research background would be able to master the higher levels of skill and understanding required for some research-­related tasks.

#### The idea of training members of the public in research methods could be considered incompatible with the underpinning principle of public involvement

> the idea of training members of the public in research methods could also be considered incompatible with the underpinning principle of valuing members of the public precisely because of the different mindsets, skills and expertise that they bring to a research team. [3] [p. 442]

#### More research needed on public involvement roletaking and research training for members of the public

> Reflective studies that specifically consider the appropriateness of roles and training for members of the public within PI are therefore needed in order to inform this debate [on wheteher members of the public should be given training in the roles they undertake in public involvement in research]. [p. 442]

#### Many issues associated with PI relate to power relationships

> Many of the pervasive issues associated with PI, such as communication difficulties, and the nature of roles undertaken, relate to the power relationships that exist between members of the public and academic clinical or academic researchers. [p. 442]

#### Power relationship issues in PI could be exacerbated by the internal power hierarchies that often exist hhwithin health and social care settings

> Many of the pervasive issues associated with PI, such as communication difficulties, and the nature of roles undertaken, relate to the power relationships that exist between members of the public and academic clinical or academic researchers. Such issues could be exacerbated by the internal power hierarchies that often exist within health and social care settings, [10] and which risk further inhibiting effective teamwork when involving the public in multidisciplinary research teams.

#### Non-hierarchical team structures in PI clearly beneficial but challenging  to achieve

> Whilst there is clear recognition of the benefits of creating a non-­hierarchical team structure, in which the contributions of all team members are equally valued, [6],[11] successfully achieving such a flat power structure therefore remains a challenge. Indeed, even when academic members have the best intentions of eliminating power differentials, their desire to protect members of the public, for instance by minimizing burden, challenge or stress, may inadvertently contribute to power imbalances. For instance, researchers working with members of breast cancer self­help groups described how they were accused of being unconsciously paternalistic by a reviewer because they had not considered it appropriate to involve the self-help group members in the analysis of data.

#### Recommendations for improving PPI activities 

> ##### Communication

> * Ground rules for communication in meetings should be collectively agreed at the start of the project, and periodically revisited. These might include procedures that enable team members to easily indicate that they do not understand or wish to say something (such as raising up their hand or a coloured card), or period checks as to whether community representatives wish to contribute or clarify anything.
> * Community representatives should be given pens and paper during meetings, and encouraged to note down thoughts that come to them.
> * A glossary of common terms (used by both academics and community representatives) could be built up through discussions, and used in meetings, to help team members to understand one another’s jargon.
> * Agreement on the type, amount, and format of information sent to community representatives between meetings (including email conversations) should be agreed on an individual basis, and periodically reviewed.
> * A ‘core plus’ approach to information sent between meetings could be considered, in which all community representatives are given a core minimum of information, but with all other information made easily available, as desired.
> * If providing long documents (e.g. interview transcripts) it may be useful to provide summaries of key points, and clear cover letters that outline why the information has been sent, and what they are expected to do with it. Community representatives should also be reminded that they can challenge the summaries if they feel that important aspects from the longer documents have been omitted or misrepresented.
> * Specific social meetings should be organised between academics and community representatives to break down social barriers and increase approachability.

> ##### Roles and responsibilities
> * Role descriptions that outline the type and extent of community representatives’ involvement can be helpful for agreeing and communicating expectations. Such role descriptions should be periodically reviewed and updated, as necessary.
> * A larger team of community representatives could be involved in the project (e.g. at different times for different roles, or just to replace members who become less available) so that the sense of burden/responsibility is reduced.
> * If community representatives are interested in developing their skills, then relevant training could be provided externally or by the research team.
> * Separate meetings should be organised specifically for academic business, such as grant funding, journal selection etc. These meetings should be open to community representatives, and yet made clear that the information discussed is unlikely to be relevant to them. To maintain transparency and inclusivity, agendas for these meetings should be circulated in advance, and minutes made available afterwards.

> ##### Resources and Productivity
> * Clear details of a meeting’s objectives and agenda should be circulated in advance.
> * Community representatives should be offered folders to help them to store and organise printed information generated by the study.
> * It may be useful to have a designated member of the team (or independent person) who community representatives could approach if they have any concerns about their involvement that they do not feel comfortable raising with the wider team.
> * Sufficient time for the additional administration and meeting time required to do PI properly should be planned and budgeted for early on.
