# Notes on Knoepke et al. (2019) - Dissemination and stakeholder engagement practices among dissemination & implementation scientists: results from an online survey

#### Nytt begrepp: 'dissemination & implementation scientists'

Här nämns de för mig nya begreppet/begreppen 'dissemination & implementation scientists'. Någon tydlig definition av vad som utmärker dessa forskare ges tyvärr inte.

#### Kort om studiens syfte
Det verkar som att denna artikel handlar om en studie i form av en enkätstudie som gått ut till forskare med frågor om dissemination och implementation. Så här motiverar de sin studie genom att nämna en tydlig kunskapslucka:

> What is less known is the extent to which there have been increases in the use of evidence based and best practices among dissemination and implementation (D&I) researchers, and if there are differences in dissemination practices across different types of D&I researchers.

Vidare skriver de:

> There has been a strong encouragement to meaningfully engage patients and community stakeholders in research from PCORI, NIH, and other organizations [10]. Two relatively recent developments of interest have been use of social media and stakeholder engagement practices [11, 12]. While each of these has existed for decades, most health care and public health researchers have not been early adopters of these approaches, and we were interested in what specific engagement strategies D&I researchers use and the extent to which they used them

Som jag tolkar det handlar det inte så mycket om att engagera engagera patienter och 'community stakeholders' i själva forskningen som sådan utan mer i spridandet av den kunskap som forskare emellan redan har fått fram, men jag kan ha fel.

#### Vilka var enkätens respondenter?

> Potential survey respondents were identified by being listed as a corresponding author on an original research article published in the journal Implementation Science between 1/1/2014 and 12/31/2017, having completed recent training related to D&I science, or had been funded to conduct D&I research.

Ja, så kan man ju också snäva av men det är väl oundvikligen så at lika barn leka bäst.

#### Definition av 'dissemination'

> Dissemination, defined as “an active approach of spreading evidence-based interventions to the target audience via predetermined channels using planned strategies” [1, 2], is the critical process linking research findings to practitioners who can implement them, leading to benefits among the people or communities of interest. [p. 2/12]

#### Frequently recommended dissemination practices

> Frequently recommended dissemination practices to reach non-research audiences include “Designing for Dissemination” [1, 3, 4], use of multiple channels, development of guides to program implementation, and engagement of multiple types of stakeholders in the development and evaluation of interventions and dissemination plans.

Detta är alltså en artikel skriven utifrån synsättet att kunskap ska tas fram av forskare och sen implementeras ute i praktiken av delvis andra än forskare. Detta synsätt skiljer sig något, skulle jag säga från tänket inom design, där man normalt utformar något mer lokalt på plats och där glappet mellan teoretisk och praktisk kunskap är mindre. 


#### Några av studiens slutsatser

> With the increasing focus on disseminating research to practice [20] and a rapidly changing landscape of dissemination strategies, it is helpful to periodically assess what strategies D&I scientists are using to communicate evidence to practitioners and policy makers. 

Det handlar alltså om att "communicate evidence to practitioners and policy makers", inte om att engagera dem på något mer djuplodande sätt än så. 

> This report updated and expanded the survey conducted in 2012 by Brownson and colleagues, but also sampled a broader range of D&I researchers (clinicians and Canadian D&I (KT) scientists) in addition to the public health researchers included in the 2012 sample, and provided greater depth on the evolving area of stakeholder engagement. 

> D&I scientists reported engaging in varied dissemination activities, some but not all of which have increased, since the 2012 survey of public health researchers.

> Comparisons were made on results from items that were identical or very similar to those reported in Brownson et al.’s earlier survey of public health researchers. Specifically, respondents in both samples reported using a variety of strategies to disseminate their work, but most frequently used traditional methods of publications in scientific journals and presentations at scientific meetings. This method is likely to influence the work of fellow researchers, who consistently report learning about emerging science in these venues [21, 22], but often neglects the seminars, professional association meetings, and electronic newsletters that local and state-level practitioners are more apt to use in their efforts to stay up-to-date [23]. The ongoing predominance of these modes of dissemination today, despite believing other methods of dissemination (including face-to-face meetings, writing policy briefs, and presenting seminars or workshops) to be potentially more effective in reaching and engaging practitioners, is likely due to the reward system of academic institutions. 

> The general sentiment that dissemination of findings to non-research partners is a core responsibility of those engaged in academic pursuits appears to be shared between the two samples, despite several differences in their respective characteristics.
