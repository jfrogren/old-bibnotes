# Notes on de Wit et al. (2018) - Preparing researchers for patient and public involvement in scientific research: development of a hands-on learning approach through action research

#### Rationale och syfte

>...it is not only patients who need education, but researchers also require practical tools, recommendations and structured training to show the benefits of PPI and provide guidance on ways to customize PPI methods for specific research projects [7,15]
[p. 753]

> It is clear that researchers need evidence to justify their PPI efforts and guidance on ways to apply the above­mentioned concepts in daily practice. [7] The literature also suggests that sustainability should be ensured by creating a “soft” infrastructure, including a culture of participation and a solid set of policies, rules and procedures. [3,5] This means that educating researchers should be combined with the establishment of a community of practice that provides active and long­term support and facilitation of senior and junior researchers. [24] It may even require a new approach to education and coaching to really enhance the implementation of meaningful PPI and to reduce the risks of tokenism. What is needed is a programme or coaching approach where researchers can simultaneously learn about PPI, debate personal values and beliefs, share practices and experiences on a regular basis and develop a shared identity around PPI. They also need an approach that integrates strategies at the level of individual researchers with those of the research institute. This is why in 2013, senior and junior researchers of the Research Centre on Autonomy and Participation of People with a Long­term Condition at Zuyd University of Applied Sciences The Netherlands developed a systematic approach to the implementation of PPI in research projects.

> The objective of this article was to describe and reflect on the development of a hands­on learning approach through a process of shared learning, debate and the exchange of experiences, supported by the provision of relevant evidence.

Denna studie visar ju att det har gjorts seriösa försök att skapa en forskningsmiljö där forskare fostras i att utföra PPI-forskning. Vilka erfarenheter kan de då dela med sig av och vilka slutsatser drar de utifrån sitt arbete med denna 'learning approach'?

Här finns en hel del matnyttigt att hämta kring upplägget och innehållet i denna utbildning. Det är forstås holländare som ligger bakom denna studie. Känns att de ligger så långt före där inom detta område. Det verkar också som att de har hämtat lite av verktygen från designområdet i utbildningen, åtminstone har den en hel del interaktiva inslag som går ut på att extrahera sina värderingar och sin kunskap på ett sätt som är kreativt.

Här finns t.ex. en 'Participation matrix' som... "gives an overview of patient and public involvement (PPI) within research projects based on the “participation game.” For example in data collection, PPI on advising means the advice of patient partners in research and consulting means PPI as participants in an interview".

Inom denna matrix delas graden av PPI in i fyra stadier: consulting; advising, partnership och control. I matrisen delas forakningsprocessen också in i steg nämligen: preparatory work; recruitment; design of PPI; data collection; analysis; identification of most important research findings; dissemination. Intressant nog används 'dissemination' som begrepp även här. För att återknyta lite till studien jag nyss läste så kan dissemination definieras så här:

> Dissemination, defined as “an active approach of spreading evidence-based interventions to the target audience via predetermined channels using planned strategies” [1, 2], is the critical process linking research findings to practitioners who can implement them, leading to benefits among the people or communities of interest. 
[@knoepke2019, p. 2/12]

Frågan är om det är denna slags dissemination som åsyftas i detta fall eller om det är något annat.

#### Structural challenges identified by the junior researcher participants
Ett annat intressant resultat i studien är de sju 'structural challenges identified by the junior researcher participants' som listas i tabell 3 [p. 759]: 

1. Unclear which organizations to contact for recruiting patient
representatives: Does the research centre have preferred organiza-
tions to consult or to work with? Does the institute keep records of
existing working relations or contact persons for patient
organizations? 
2. Patient and public involvement (PPI) insufficiently specified in
research proposals: How much PPI can be done without missing
important deadlines?
3. Uncertainty about the priority of PPI in the views of the research
centre. How much time am I allowed to spend on PPI? Will I be
supported by my superiors when input of patient representatives
leads to changes in the design, conduct or outcomes of my study?
4. Lack of guidance on how to budget for meaningful PPI
5. Absence of a policy for remunerating patient representatives in
research projects. For example: Is it possible to pay a symposium fee
for a patient representative? Is there a budget for child care for a
patient representative? Is it allowed to pay patient representatives
for their involvement? And if so, what is a reasonable compensation?
6. Lack of guidance on recognizing the contributions of patient
representatives, not only individually, but also at the level of the
research centre.
7. Do regulations exist for acknowledgement or co-­authorship of
documents, brochures and scientific manuscripts?


#### Slutsats

> We conclude that a stepwise approach, based on action research, coaching and dialogue between peers, empowers senior and junior researchers to acquire concepts and tools to engage patients in a meaningful way. We recommended distinguishing between the roles and responsibilities of senior and of junior researchers.
[p. 762]

Anledningen till att de ser uppdelningen mellan juniora och seniora forskare som fruktbar bottnar i detta:

> We also learned the importance of differentiating between the tasks and responsibilities of senior and junior researchers....supporting PPI is not the same as facilitating. Providing this coaching programme is an example of facilitating PPI, meaning that the institute’s leadership acknowledged the need for PPI coaching for researchers, and assumed responsibility for providing the resources to make this happen. 
[p. 761]
