# Notes on Ottinger, G. (2017) - Making sense of citizen science: stories as a hermeneutic resource

Ej tillräckligt relevant för min studie 2.

Dock för studie 3. Här beskrivs t.ex. hur citizen science kan utgöra en metod för att motverka eller bekämpa epistemisk orättvisa:

> Citizen science can be seen as a response to epistemic injustice in frontline communities. Community-driven data-collection eﬀorts in particular, which have included air monitoring with homemade “buckets” [7,12], water monitoring in areas aﬀected by natural gas drilling [5], and health surveys designed and conducted by community members [10], confront testimonial injustice by giving marginalized speakers quantitative information to bolster their credibility when talking to experts who might otherwise be quick to dismiss what they have to say on the basis of who they are. [p. 43]

Vidare beskrivs betydelsen av *storytelling*, som en metod för marginaliserade grupper att skaffa sig mer makt över sin situation och därmed bättre möjligheter att förändra den:

> In environmental justice realm, storytelling has been an especially important tool for meaning-making. One goal of EJ activism has been to enhance the ability of marginalized communities, including frontline communities, to speak for themselves [45]. In that context, storytelling is not only a powerful way for community members’ voices to be heard [27] but also a mechanism for weaving together individuals’ heterogeneous experiences into collective knowledge about a place, its history, and the threats posed to it by pollution or industrial development [40]. Further, to a much greater extent than in policy realms, where elites control the stories, EJ storytelling gives community groups a way to refuse dominant narratives about them, and advance their own, alternative understandings of their communities, how they’ve been treated, what is owed to them by regulators and other dominant groups, and what their future should look like [40,41]. [p. 43]

Detta sistnämnda knyter an väldigt bra till den sista delen i Steve McQueens miniserie [Small Axe](https://archive.fo/VRjkS), Education, som beskriver just betydelsen för en utsatt commmunity och dess individer att bottna i en gemensam berättelse som utgår gruppens egen historia och erfarenheter.
