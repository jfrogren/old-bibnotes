# Notes on Jokstad, K., Landmark, B. T., & Skovdahl, K. (2020) - Person-centred research practice: the user involvement in research of older adults with first-hand experience of reablement

Detta verkar vara ett accepterat manuskript, frågan är om det snart finns som publikation i en tidskrift. Har känskan av att försteförfattaren är en (norsk) doktorand med tanke på språket. Hur som helst finns det en del matnyttigt att hämta här eftersom området är snarlikt mitt.

Så här står det om syftet:

> In this article we describe and reflect on the processes and outcomes associated with advisory group-researcher collaboration. Our reflections emanate from our experience with the user-involvement of older adults with health-related conditions and first-hand experience in an advisory group.

Och forskningsfrågorna:

1) What are the important prerequisites associated with facilitating the user involvement of older adults with health-related conditions in research?
2) How can the involvement of older adults with first-hand experience improve research quality and relevance?
3) How can the involvement of older adults with health-related conditions and first-hand experience contribute to the improvement of person-centredness in research?

Det som betonas är att denna grupp har en health-related condition och förstahandserfarenhet av  som anses relevant för studien. Här argumenteras för att det inte finns så mycket forskning när det gäller involvering av personer med den sortens tillstånd och erfarenhet:

> apart from studies where older adults were included as research objects or informants, a relatively small number of studies on involvement in research of older adults with health-related conditions and first-hand experience currently exist. Also, findings on barriers to the involvement of such groups and the impact their involvement can have on research are limited and inconclusive. This indicates that more knowledge on the topic is needed.

När det kommer till definitionen av 'public involvement' står här:

> In one widely used definition of public involvement in research, research is viewed as being carried out ‘with’ or ‘by’ rather than ‘for’, ‘about’ or ‘to’ members of the public (INVOLVE, 2012). In that definition, public refers to the range of people and groups that may be involved in research: patients, potential patients, carers and people who use health and/or social care services as well as people from organisations who represent those who use such services. The use of the propositions ‘with’ and ‘by’ imply public involvement during all research steps: what to explore and how the research should be carried out, analysed and disseminated.

Inom UserAge använder vi ju oss också av en sådan definition, men har den sin upprinnelse i INVOLVE alltså? Sannolikt inte men frågan är vilken referens som är lämplig för mig att använda. Vidare skriver artikelförfattaren:

> Research initiatives in which older adults are involved as co-researchers often take the form of invitations from researchers (Fudge, Wolfe and McKevitt, 2007). Participants found in this manner seldom have personal or first-hand experience of the research topic (Ward and Gahagan, 2012). Instead, the focus in such research is placed on age as an indicator of representativeness. In a review on the impact of involving older adults in research that encompassed 30 studies, most studies did not give further participant details other than that the participants were aged 50+ (Fudge et al., 2007). In another review that encompassed nine studies, older adults as co-researchers were seen in some of the studies to have experience from the area being studied or had old-age-related conditions, but most studies did not give further participant details (Baldwin, Napier, Neville and Wright-St Clair, 2018).

Detta är ju intressant, att dessa studier tillkommer på initiativ av forskare, samt att co-researcher ofta inte har personlig eller förstahandskunskap om det ämne det forskas om.

Sedan är det ju tragiska att människor i den här sortens studier endast blir en siffra och några andra aspekter än ålder inte direkt räknas med.

#### Vad får co-researchers ut av att vara med?

> Baldwin et al. found that older co-researchers experienced both benefits and challenges when participating in research: psychological and social benefits, new learning, activism and career opportunities but also demanding workloads, difficult relationships and dissatisfaction with the level of involvement.

#### Vad får academic researchers ut av att vara med?

> Academic researchers who included older co-researchers in their research experienced new learning and shared workloads, but also demanding workloads an difficult relationships (Baldwin et al., 2018).

#### Hur påverkar co-researcher involvement forskningsprocessen och utkomsten av forskningen?

> In their review, Fudge et al. found anecdotal evidence that the involvement of older adults as co-researchers resulted in changes on the individual level but found little evaluation of how such involvement changed research processes or outcomes (Fudge et al., 2007).

#### Vad behöver man som forskare tänka på när man involverar äldre i forskning på detta sätt? Krävs någon form av anpassningar?

> In a review of the methods used to involve older adults in health research, nine studies that fit the definition of PPI in research as delineated by INVOLVE were included. The researchers saw that while the involvement in research of older adults with old-age-related conditions is feasible, there could be specific challenges (Schilling and Gerhardus, 2017). In that review, strategies that can enhance the effective involvement of older adults with old-age-related conditions in research were identified, such as thoughtful choice of location, use of visualisation and accessible communication, building good relationships and flexible approaches. Conversely, in another review, Fudge et al. (2007) found no specific barriers to the involvement of older adults in research. The different findings may be due to the fact that Schilling and Gerhardus explicitly sought out studies that included older adults with old-age-related conditions related to the research topic.

#### Slutsats?

Slutsatsen i artikeln var dessvärre en besvikelse. Så här står det:

> We found that engaging older adults with first-hand experience of reablement in an advisory group on a consultant level in the initial phase of a research project was highly beneficial and therefore can be advocated. The members in our advisory group had first-hand experience of reablement, but our findings and experiences may be relevant to other similar person-centred research projects where older adults with health-related conditions are involved as co-researchers.
