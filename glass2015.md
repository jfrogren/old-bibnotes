# Notes on Glass, R. D., & Newman, A. (2015) - Ethical and epistemic dilemmas in knowledge production: addressing their intersection in collaborative, community-based research

#### Om Collaborative community-based research'(CCBR)

Här talas om 'Collaborative community-based research'(CCBR). Vad menas med det? Jo, det refererar till att...

> University researchers across a range of disciplines are increasingly collaborating with communities to investigate urgent social, economic, and policy problems. [p.24]

På vilket sätt tar sig detta samarbete sig uttryck? Jo...

> ...by involving community members as research partners instead of merely as research ‘subjects’ in the traditional sense. By co-developing research questions and carrying out the work in partnership with communities, scholars engaged in this type of research can help universities respond to calls to be more civically engaged [p. 24]

Det svarar mot krav på universiteten att bli mer samhällsengagerade i sin inriktning. Vidare beskrivs och motiveras denna typ av forskning så här:

> By drawing on community members’ local knowledge and experiences, CCBR both incorporates insights that may otherwise be overlooked and produces more relevant findings. Furthermore, CCBR can facilitate more inclusive public deliberations about important policy issues because it involves often-marginalized community members in knowledge production throughout the research process: from determining research questions, to gathering and interpreting data, to disseminating findings and developing policy proposals. [p. 24]

#### Syfte 

> In this article, we examine this growing type of empirical inquiry [CCBR] to understand its ethical and epistemic benefits and challenges, as well as its implications for research ethics more generally [p. 24]

Hur ämnar de då göra detta? Jo...

> ...we are not drawing upon empirical studies directly, but rather we are reflecting upon the benefits and challenges of one mode of empirical inquiry. We think this type of analysis represents an important and complementary form of philosophic engagement with empirical research: to reflect upon the dilemmas inherent in the research methodologies that scholars employ and, more foundationally, to identify how research can help mitigate systemic inequalities. [p. 25]

Metoden är alltså att "reflecting upon" i sann filosofisk tradition. Det de skriver här är att det finns dilemman som är "inherent in the research methodologies that scholars employ" samt implicit att det bör åligga forskningen att "help mitigate systemic inequalities" (vad som nu menas med det.) Jo, för att motivera eller redovisa varför de anser att det åligger universiteten att rikta in sig på detta skriver de sedan följande:

> In order to establish why such aims are relevant to scholarly research, we begin by considering the democratic mission of universities and the relationships among their ethical, epistemic, and political commitments. [p. 25]

#### Relationen mellan rättvisa och kunskapsproduktion är erkänd inom filosofin
> Philosophers have addressed relationships // among justice and knowledge production (e.g. Anderson, 1995), and at least since Dewey’s 1916 Democracy and Education (Dewey, 2011) they have attended to how social scientific inquiry can support democratic practices (e.g. Anderson, 2006; Bohman, 1999). There has also been growing attention by philosophers to the ethical nature of epistemic practices. [ref. 1] [p. 24-25]

#### Universities and justice in knowledge production

> In her 1995 article ‘The Democratic University: The Role of Justice in the Production of Knowledge’, Elizabeth Anderson addresses the politics in higher education from an egalitarian perspective. She argues that conservative allegations that universities are hostage to liberal ideology are misguided in their assumption that knowledge production can be an apolitical process.

Här föreligger en felaktig slutsats skulle jag säga, dock utan att ha läst Elizabeth Andersons text. Men om konservativa anklagar universitet för att vara gisslan hos en liberal ideologi betyder ju inte det i sig att de menar att kunskapsproduktion kan och bör vara apolitisk om de inte uttryckligen säger det. Det borde ju vara fullt möjligt att vara konservativ och socialkonstruktionist, eller? 

Hur som helst, så här redovisas Andersons argumentation om varför universitet oundvikligen ör politiska institutioner:

> Universities are political, she agrees, but not because of partisan commitments. Rather, they are unavoidably political institutions because inquiry is a social endeavor and thereby implicates foundational political questions about membership and communication within universities. Anderson notes that inquiry is a social pursuit in at least three primary ways: because we test our findings against the metrics of others, because there is a social criterion of publicity for what counts as reasons to believe (we cannot simply command others to believe), and because discoveries and new insights must be verified by others to be accepted (p. 190). That is, ‘what one believes crucially depends on whom one believes’ (Anderson, 1995: 189). Therefore, the task at hand, she argues, is not to remove politics from the university but rather to determine what ‘political epistemology’ the university should embrace given its mission of generating warranted knowledge claims.

Jag tycker att detta är mycket klokt och håller åtminstone så långt med henne. Vidare skriver de att Anderson förkastar en libertariansk modell eftersom den...

> ...is vulnerable to failures in the marketplace of ideas when some individuals are denied access to forums for inquiry, when the equality of some inquirers is undermined, or when constraints on certain content or types of speech contribute to the circulation of false or unwarranted claims (Anderson, 1995: 196–197).

Exakt vad som utmärker en libertariansk modell och vad som skiljer den från en liberal är för mig oklart men jag tolkar det som att i den förra så är det ett hårdare och inte lika inkluderande debattklimat utan mer principen att den starkes röst vinner. Enligt författarna så endorsar Anderson istället en liberaldemokratisk epistemiologi som...

>...is predicated on competent adults’ universal access to the academy and their egalitarian participation in inquiry (p. 203). [p. 26]

En epistemiologi som bejakar mångfalden och där...

> We obviously should reject hierarchies that are irrelevant to epistemic concerns and are themselves unethical [...] such as giving more credence to the claims of White males and discounting the claims of working class individuals or minorities (p. 204). [p. 26]

Men artikelförfattarna riktar kritik mot Andersons synsätt främst eftersom de anser att...

> ...her university-centric account overlooks knowledge forms that emerge or exist outside the disciplined halls of academe, as well as the possibility of academic knowledge production that includes the broader public. [p. 26]

samt att hon...

> ...does not go far enough in grasping how authorized knowledge (including that sanctioned by universities) as well as ‘common sense’ (Gramsci, 1992) can impose epistemic injustices.[p. 26]

Vidare skriver de att hennes...

> ...positive view still falls short of recognizing the wealth of knowledge of individuals outside the academy who do not seek the forms of membership and participation she writes of (and who may even have strategic reasons for not making their knowledge known to such institutions). It also falls short of recognizing other sorts of ethical and epistemic responsibilities universities might have, particularly with regard to disadvantaged communities.

#### Freires frigörande pedagogik

Artikelförfattarna beskriver Freires 'liberatory pedagogy' så här:

> Freire’s liberatory pedagogy, through which those who suffer from injustice ‘know better // what they already know’ and ‘name’ their reality for themselves (Freire, 1970; Glass, 2001). [p. 28-29]

Och kommenterar den så här att:

> Such critical knowledge production can expand the hermeneutical resources for all members of the community and is an important contribution to the balancing of the scales of epistemic justice. [p. 29]

Med andra ord att t.ex. den minoritet som varit utsatt för något övergrepp tillåts och tilldelas resurser att sätta ord på den och spride den kunskapen till en bredare allmänhet. Och att denna kunskap utgör ett viktigt bidrag i arbetet för epistemisk rättvisa. 


#### Kritik mot Frickers teoriom epistemisk orättvisa
De gör en mycket bra sammanfattning av Miranda Frickers teori om epistemisk orättvisa men riktar samtidigt en kritik mot den då de tycker att hon missar att...

> ...the exclusion of knowledge forms outside the sphere of propositional knowledge that is sanctioned by the university could itself be considered as a kind of both testimonial and hermeneutic epistemic injustices. It is a form of testimonial injustice when, because of identity prejudice, people’s claims are dismissed as ‘mere’ intuitions, vague feelings, or the like. This testimonial injustice transmutes into a form of hermeneutical injustice – one that Fricker has yet to recognize – when those very people who are ideologically demeaned as knowers (e.g. women, people of color) are thereby denied the opportunity to reinterpret the world for themselves and others. In this respect, Fricker’s notion of hermeneutical injustice undervalues the knowledge already possessed by marginalized individuals or communities and thereby fails to consider how that knowledge can be mobilized (such as through CCBR). [p. 29]

#### Kritik mot universitetens negligerande av kunskap från 'disadvantaged communities' och ett förordande av CCBR som "an essential approach for combating epistemic injustice in scholarly research"

> Scholars largely generate their research questions in isolation from disadvantaged communities (even if they share identity markers with those communities) and in conversation with previously published research that, for all the reasons // of epistemic injustice we have reviewed, itself excludes the knowledge, interests, and concerns of those communities. Thus, scholars may produce many volumes of ‘damage-centered research’ (Tuck, 2009) about the impacts of US mass incarceration on communities of color, but they produce vastly less research on those communities’ resilience and modes of being that are not defined by dominant ideologies and institutions. [p. 31-32]

> In contrast,equity-oriented CCBR begins with the knowledge, questions, and interests of communities and develops research programs that investigate issues otherwise outside the attention of the dominant culture. [p. 32]

> In practice, this means that CCBR involves multiple iterative processes that reside at the ethico-epistemic intersection. Whether determining research questions, obtaining informed consent, gathering data, or reporting findings, researchers must engage in ongoing conversations with community partners to actualize respectful and egalitarian working relationships. Both the structure and the operations of the research project must be iteratively fine-tuned to enable the discernment of shared goals, of mutually meaningful and significant research questions, and of possibilities for ethically, epistemically, and politically transformative engagements. This relational, iterative process stands in stark contrast to the transactional mode of research whereby researchers define the parameters of the work apart from their subjects and then obtain consent from them as a discrete transaction (Newman and Glass, 2014a, 2014b). [p. 34]

> Neither Fricker nor Anderson recognizes a possibility for scholars and community members to collaborate in this kind of formal knowledge production to enrich public knowledge. Thus, they do not recognize how to further epistemic justice through partnerships that respect individuals outside the academy as knowledge-bearers and knowledge-producers, not merely as research subjects. We believe that this is an essential approach for combating epistemic injustice in scholarly research. [p. 32]




#### Slutsatser

> Collaborative community-based research can bring a range of benefits to universities, communities, and the public more broadly. [p. 23]

> CCBR importantly recognizes that epistemic and ethical dimensions of research are entangled with one another. [p. 24]

> A distinct virtue of collaborative community-based research is that it makes the ethical–epistemic intersections and challenges in research a focal point of its methodology. This makes collaborative community-based research well positioned to address various forms of ‘epistemic injustice’ (Fricker, 2007) that demean certain people and groups as knowers and exclude them from knowledge production. [p. 23]

> Our analysis leads us to argue that universities should support CCBR for both epistemic and ethical reasons and for the benefits that accrue to the broader public. [p. 24]
