# Notes on Berge et al. (2020) - Challenging oneself on the threshold to the world of research--frail older people’s experiences of involvement in research

#### Slutsatser

> ...frail older people have a varied capacity to be involved. But in what way and how is difficult to know before [...] In collaboration with researchers, frail older people are given the chance to assess what they want to and are able to do. [p. 9]

> Our results advocate that it is problematic to exclude frail older people a priori and that there is potential for new perspectives and knowledge to be shaped in the encounter and in the relationship between the researcher and the frail older person. [p. 9]

> In the research relationship between the frail older person and the researcher, there are opportunities, but also obstacles based on the different worlds both come from. In research without user involvement, there are needs, perspectives and resources that run the risk of being left out. For research to be able to cater to frail older people’s needs of health services, their voices need to be heard and taken into consideration. Otherwise, there is a risk that health services will continue to treat the group of frail older people based on the wishes and perspectives of other groups. [p. 9]
